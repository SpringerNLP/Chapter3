viewed\nskeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and\ntrade sources.\n    \"Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and \nimporters, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of\nthe past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it\nbecame a matter of the trade monitoring each other,\" one\nanalyst said.\n    On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said\nthe Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a\nvoluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to\nmonitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.\n    Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee\nimporters would voluntarily present needed documents to the\nU.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring\nauthority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,\nit will still be allowed entry.\n    While many believe producers will not seek to add to the\noverburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some\nwill ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of\nmonitoring controls, trade sources said.\n    \"Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted\nto customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,\" a\nU.S. Customs spokesman said.\n    \"Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when\nits hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand\nForm O (documents tracking merchandise from source to\ndestination),\" he said.\n    Many see it as a true test of whether producers and\nimporters will abide by the quota system.\n    \"It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the\nquota agreement,\" said one major U.S. roaster.\n     \"Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did\nnot act as a gentleman,\" said another analyst adding, \"without\nthe need to submit documents, the ball will be in the\nproducers' hands.\"\n    Some feel that importers will take advantage of the\nvoluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,\nin which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.\nMany fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member\ncountries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely\nlabelled.\n    According to customs officials, several green coffee\nimporters confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee\nfraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,\nforging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy\nbeans.\n    \"If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for\none country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of\ntheir stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by\ncircumventing the quota provisions,\" said Paine Webber analyst\nBernie Savaiko.\n    Still, others believe that producers will not be hard\npressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in\nthe U.S. in the near term.\n    \"It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not\nhave some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system\nseemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so\nmuch coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a\nthreat,\" one trader said.\n

It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -\nthe US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.\n    The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets\nand the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading\nin New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was\nquoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.\n    Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche\nGenossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world\nstock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West\nGerman short-term interest rates on Tuesday.\n    \"The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market\nlosses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits\nwith Baker's wishes, then all the better,\" he said.\n    No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the\nBundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises\nin the U.S., Aschoff said.\n    Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central\nbank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he\nthought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.\n    Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston\nLtd in London said \"The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat\nand Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the\nsecurity repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was\nbefore the IMF meeting last month in Washington.\"\n    Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was\nreaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity\nat 3.60 pct, Keating noted.\n    Economists said the United States now appeared to have\nagreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support\nthe dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.\n    Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder\nWashington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg\ntold a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule\nout central banks of leading industrial countries intervening\non exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.\n    Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West\nGermany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency\nstability.

Maybe it's better it happened at all.\"\n    Rex Hardesty of the huge labor confederation AFL-CIO said\nmany of the present safeguards are not working, saying \"only\none-third of the unemployed are now receiving benefits.\"\n    He also called for an increase in the 3.35 dlr minimum wage\nwhich has not been raised since 1981.\n    One of the main things that appears different in 1987 than\nin 1929 is market psychology, analysts point out.\n    During those anything goes days of flappers and bathtub\ngin, the stock market was the road to riches that captured the\nsavings of shoeshine boys to bank presidents. It was viewed as\na highway to heaven with no turning back.\n    But happy days soon collapsed into a nationwide, hysterical\npanic with the stock market crash, wiping out paper millions\nand losing the life savings of many average investors as panic\nset in.\n    Brokers leaped from Wall Street skyscrapers. American banks\nclosed for a  \"holiday\" in 1933 as depositors clamored to pull\nout their savings. The great depression followed leading into\nWorld War II.\n    Images of those days surfaced with the unprecedented sell\noff on Monday, but analysts maintained times are different.\n    House Banking committee specialist Jake Lewis said that\nbank investors should have no fears because their savings are\nnow completely backed by the government. \n    Even though there have been record bank failures --145 last\nyear, 148 this year through today--everyone received their\nsavings--unlike the millions lost when banks collapsed 60 years\nago.\n     Banking deposits, then uninsured, now are fully insured by\nthe government up to 100,000 dlrs for each saver.\n    As the depression swept the nation, President Franklin\nRoosevelt steered into law sweeping banking and securities\nreforms to deal with many of the problems that led to the crash\nand hurt people afterwards.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"20-OCT-1987 15:12:44.05","places":["usa"]},"20615":{"title":"LITTON INDUSTRIES SAYS BOARD RAISED SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORITY BY TWO MLN SHARES\n","date":"20-OCT-1987 15:13:03.24"},"20616":{"title":"REFCO SAYS NOT IN FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY","body":"Refco Inc denied it is having financial\ndifficulties and said it did not halt oil futures trading\ntoday, John O'Connell, assistant vice president of research\ntold Reuters.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"20-OCT-1987 15:14:18.17","places":["usa"]},"20617":{"title":"INGERSOLL-RAND THIRD QTR PER SHARE 41 CTS VS 39 CTS\n","date":"20-OCT-1987 15:15:13.10"},"20618":{"title":"OWENS-ILLINOIS <OI> EXTENDS BROCKWAY <BRK> OFFER","body":"Owens-Illinois Inc said its\nsubsidiary's 60 dlr a share cash tender offer for all the\noutstanding common shares of Brockway Inc has been extended to\nmidnight October 30.\n    The offer had been scheduled to expire at midnight October\n21.\n    Owens-Illinois said that as of Oct 19, 1,598,789 common\nshares, or about 13 pct of the outstanding shares of Brockway\nhave been tendered.\n    It said it and Brockway are preparing responses to the\npreviously announced request for additional information from\nthe Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.\n    The Owens-Illinois subsidiary, which began the tender offer\non September 23, will not be able to buy Brockway's common\nshares until 10 days following Owens-Illinois compliance with\nthe FTC request or other conditions.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"20-OCT-1987 15:15:22.25","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"20619":{"title":"BANC ONE <ONE> TO REPURCHASE FIVE MLN SHARES","body":"Banc One Corp said its board\nauthorized the repurchase of up to 5,000,000 shares of its\ncommon stock.\n    The company currently has about 98.0 mln shares\noutstanding.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"20-OCT-1987 15:16:15.33","places":["usa"]},"20620":{"title":"WEST VIRGINIA FREE OF TWO MAJOR CATTLE DISEASES","body":"West Virginia has been declared free\nof tuberculosis and brucellosis from its cattle population, the\nU.S. Agriculture Department said.\n    It said a state is recognized as tuberculosis-free if no\ncase of the disease is diagnosed for at least five years and if\nthe state complies with the uniform methods and rules of the\nstate-federal cooperative eradication program.\n    To achieve brucellosis-free status, a state's cattle\npopulation must remain uninfected for the previous 12 months.\n    There are 33 states, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands,\nclassified as free of bovine tuberculosis and 24 states, plus\nPuerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which have eradicated\nbrucellosis.

as a target in the retaliatory attack\nmounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the\nIran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.\n    U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and\nraided another in what the administration called a \"measured and\nappropriate response\" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last\nFriday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.\n    Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig\nrather than an onshore economic or military target such as\nSilkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to\nlimit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at\nhome and in the Gulf.\n    \"It simply demonstrated the United States will take military\naction when they (Iran) take military action,\" Norman Polmar, a\ndefense analyst and author, said.\n    He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the\nembarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding\nan escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.\n    In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the\npotential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that\ncould have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.\n    Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq\nwar, said the United States apparently chose a limited target\nto keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General\nJavier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a\nSecurity Council call for a ceasefire.\n    \"We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any\nchance at all,\" he said, adding that the action made it clear\ntougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.\n\n   In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon\nto have been turned into a military command post -- Washington\nalso sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's\neconomic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had\nbeen used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the\nlower Gulf.\n    \"We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown\nIran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting\ncapabilities,\" Cordesman said.\n    He predicted the United States would respond to any future\nmajor Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar\nAbbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the\napproaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.\n    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the\nUnited States did

That, I\nthink, was partly due to statements that have been made by\nsenior figures on the other side of the Atlantic.\" It was a\ndispute that should never have happened, he added.\n    Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a\nhastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  \nstill faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United\nStates on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to\nScandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.\n    Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, \"His\ntiming could not have been worse.\"\n    One government bond salesman in New York said, \"He actually\nthought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack\nthe dollar down would work. That doesn't show much\nunderstanding of international monetary gamesmanship.\"\n    However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march\ntoward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.\n    \"On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if\nyou go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial\nmarkets), it was West German policy,\" said Robert Brusca of\nNikko Securities International in New York.\n    \"All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so\nmaking him responsible for it was a little like killing the\nmessenger,\" he said.\n    After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments\nmade it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together\nin Paris in February, was still in effect.\n    Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be\na prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to\nthe late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash\nwiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.\n   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about\nBonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the\nglobal recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest\nrate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.\n    He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th\nmonth, could no longer be the only engine of global economic\nexpansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge\nmarket for debtor country exports.\n    Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried\nthat the Republican party might face next year's presidential\nelection with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly\ntarnished.\n    A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt\ncrisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has\nalready slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.\n    \"There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the\neconomy, and it's important that the psychology turn around\nquickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and\neventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,\"\nformer deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a\ntelevision interview.\n    In many ways, the official response was mild.\n    Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,\nwith President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting\nthat he was \"puzzled.\"\n    U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately\nreturned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments\nand, presumably, their political impact.\n    For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in\nWashington will diminish because of the market fall.\n    Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because\nof the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd\nBentsen said with some irony, \"Oh, I think it's much too late to\nbe doing that...You have an administration that's taken the\nattitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---\nretire to the living room to take a nap.

It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.\n    The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market\nreacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest\nrates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that\nWest Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.\n    Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to\ncoordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with\nthe surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating\ntheir economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget\ndeficit.\n    West German government sources said rising West German\nmoney market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre\npact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest\nrates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising\nsince May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed\nraised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.\n    German yields have also risen over this period, but less\nmarkedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up\nshort-term rates by changing the terms on its security\nrepurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the\nmoney market.\n    The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,\ncompared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's\ninability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,\nbut also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the\nBundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary\ngrowth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,\nbank economists said.\n    This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the\npragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl\nsince early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the\nmore cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.\n    In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,\nthe Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this\nmorning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.\nanger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.\n    \"They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much\nunder American fire,\" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at\nSwiss Bank Corp here.\n    \"It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a\nsignificant retreat from its position,\" added Giles Keating,\neconomist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.\n    The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of\nthe Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact\non Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market\neconomists said.\n    Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank\ndoes not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation\nrate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,\nlittle changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.\n    The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication\nthat the meeting would take place, although the Finance\nMinistry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.\n    Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to\ncomment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre\naccord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he\nassumed monetary cooperation would continue.\n    The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West\nGermany for Sweden on Monday.
