unlikely to change\ncredit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday\nfor its last session before the Venice summit, banking\neconomists and money market dealers said.\n    The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month\nby cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is\nunlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates\nin the near future, they said.\n    The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will\nbe followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.\n    But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was\nusually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and\ndid not necessarily herald any policy moves.\n    Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today\nthere was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply\ngrowth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was\nstable against the mark.\n    Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has\nopened a representative office, that the West German economy\nwas now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted\n1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.\n    Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in\na 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the\nBundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a\nminimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.\n    \"They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe\nlower market rates even further, but not with the discount or\nLombard,\" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,\nMunchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.\n    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said\nGerman rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and\naround historical lows for West Germany.\n    A further cut in rates would have little impact on the\neconomy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,\nwith companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.\n    The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move\non interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.\n\"The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,\" he said.\n    A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in\nline with the new structure of money market rates since last\nmonth, would have little practical significance, dealers said.\n    The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a\ndiplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.\n    But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it\nclear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere \"eyewash.\"\n    Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to\ncut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary\npolicy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.\n    But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax\ncuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget\ndeficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.\n    \"The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in\nVenice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,\"\nsaid Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.\n    Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before\nVenice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. \"But I\ndon't expect any convincing measures,\" he said.\n    Money market dealers noted that call money continued to\nnormalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday\nand as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by\nmonth-end distortions.\n    Call money could come under upwards pressure later this\nmonth because of a major round of tax payments by banks on\nbehalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.\nTwo public holidays that week could also distort the market.\n    Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds\ntomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55\npct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,\nand to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.\n    But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would\nallocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not\nrepresent a tightening of policy, however.\n    Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates\nat the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full\nallocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.\n    On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely\nto lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency\nUnit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.\n    Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement\non this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the\nSaarland bordering France, and was twice under French\noccupation this century.\n    But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come\nthis week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still\nto be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be\ntreated for minimum reserve purposes.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 2-JUN-1987 11:47:07.87","topics":["interest","money-fx"],"places":["west-germany"]},"18087":{"title":"UGANDAN GOODWILL MISSION TO VISIT KENYA","body":"A Ugandan goodwill mission led by\nminister of state in the presidency Balaki Kirya will visit\nKenya tomorrow for talks on improving strained relations\nbetween the two countries, diplomatic sources said.\n    If the talks go well, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is\nlikely to have a meeting with Kenyan leader Daniel arap Moi\nwhen he pays a two-day visit to Nairobi to attend U.N\nceremonies on Friday and Saturday, they added.\n    Relations between the two states showed the first signs of\nrecovery yesterday after three months of steady deterioration.\n    The Kenyan President told a military parade there was no\nborder tension with Uganda and the Kenyan border was fully open\nfor cargo movements.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 2-JUN-1987 11:48:00.14","places":["kenya","uganda"]},"18088":{"title":"NEW YORK LIFE OFFERING A GLOBAL MUTUAL FUND","body":"<New York Life Insurance Co> said it is\noffering its first global mutual fund through its wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, MacKay-Shields Financial Corp.\n    The new fund is called the MacKay-Shields Global Fund, the\ncompany said.

He is a central banker of\ngood repute with a general interest in protecting the U.S. And\ninternational banking system,\" said Libra's Santistevan.\n    Volcker knows and understands the problems facing indebted\ncountries, he said, adding that it is unlikely Greenspan is as\nfamiliar with the problem and the personalities involved.\n    For this reason he expects there will be little change in\nthe Fed's approach to the debt crisis, even as U.S. Commercial\nbanks take a harder line in dealing with the problem by adding\nbillions of dollars in reserves against possible losses on\nthird world debt.\n    Another senior banker who deals with the Latin American\ndebt problem also doubted there would be much change\npost-Volcker, but for other reasons.\n    He said that despite U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's\ndebt initiative which called for greater contributions by\nbanks, governments and multilateral organization, government's\nhave done little to try to improve the situation, leaving the\nbulk of the responsibility in the hands of the bankers.\n    Despite the Fed's independence from central government, he\nquestioned how much impact Greenspan could have coming into the\njob so close to the next Presidential election.\n    News that Volcker would not seek a third term hit the\nfinancial markets hard.  The U.S. Dollar fell sharply on\nforeign exchange markets before reported concerted central bank\nintervention by the Fed and the Bundesbank helped it recover\nsomewhat. Prices of Eurodollar denominated bonds fell about one\npoint, while prices of U.S. Treasury bonds traded here lost\nmore than one point.\n    But despite the disruption in the markets, Lloyds Bank\nPlc's Group Economic Adivser Christopher Johnson said the\nannouncement was well-timed, given the recent rise in the\ndollar against the mark and yen.\n    In recent statements U.S. Officials have said the dollar\nhas fallen far enough and at a White House briefing today\nannouncing his nomination Greenspan said \"there certainly is\nevidence\" that the dollar had bottomed out.\n    However, many economists here believe that the recent rise\nin the dollar will be only temporary and that it will have to\nfall further before America's huge trade deficit begins to\nreverse.\n    \"The dollar has further to fall, although it may take a few\nyears\" said Lloyds Bank's Johnson. He added that the important\nthing is that there is a soft landing.\n    Like other economists, Johnson is anxious to hear\nGreenspan's testify at the Congressional confirmation hearings.\n    \"He has everything going for him but he must establish\ncredibility.

The other five members are Reagan appointees.\n    What may unsettle markets, however, is the fact that the\nFed governors now have only six to seven years' collective\nexperience between them, at a time of great financial\nuncertainty.\n    Analysts said that while Greenspan might well be considered\nas tough an inflation-fighter as Volcker, his Republican\ncredentials could make him more of a political Fed chairman\nthan Volcker.\n    An administration official said Volcker was consulted on\nGreenspan \"and very much approved of his replacement.\"\n    But one analyst compared Greenspan's relationship to the\nadministration, to whom he has been an unofficial economic\nadviser, with the relationship former chairman Arthur Burns had\nwith the Nixon administration.\n    Burns was somewhat more sympathetic to the administration\nviewpoint than Volcker has been, and Burns was less willing to\nmake radical policy changes.\n    Making clear his decision was a strong one, Volcker told\nreporters, \"I told (Reagan) with considerable definitiveness\nyesterday.\" Administration officials said Volcker arrived at the\nWhite House yesterday afternoon with his resignation.\n    When renominated in mid-1983, Volcker said he would\nprobably step down within two years. Monetary sources said the\ndeparture of Donald Regan as Treasury Secretary was one factor\nthat convinced him to stay on. Regan and Volcker clashed almost\nfrom the start of the administration.\n    Another, these sources said, was the prospect of being able\nto work with Baker as Treasury Secretary to tackle the\ninternational debt crisis and deal with the then high-flying\ndollar.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 2-JUN-1987 16:38:43.85","places":["usa"]},"18300":{"title":"PROFESSOR LIFTS BANC TEXAS <BTX> PREFERRED STAKE","body":"A University of Massachusetts finance\nprofessor said he raised his stake in Banc Texas Group Inc to\n45,340 shares of 1.4625 dlr cumulative preferred stock, or 7.4\npct of the total, from 30,300 shares, or 5.0 pct.\n    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nBen Shirley Branch also said he bought 52,025 shares of Class A\ncumulative convertible preferred stock, or 5.9 pct of the\ntotal, for 160,000 dlrs, bringing his total investment in both\npreferred series to about 330,000 dlrs.\n    Branch said he bought the stock as an investment, but\nreserved the right to try to influence the company.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 2-JUN-1987 16:40:49.41","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"18301":{"title":"AHMANSON <AHM> TO TAKE 2ND QTR WRITEOFF","body":"H.F.

divided them since they were\nfirst announced in March.\n    The most controversial aspects of these proposals are a\nplan to tax all vegetable and marine oils and fats to finance\nrapidly increasing production subsidies and technical measures\nwhich would change the way common EC farm prices are converted\ninto member state currencies.\n    West German delegation sources, who have opposed both

manufacturing\nin developing countries so that those nations can become\nconsumers of more U.S. goods.\n    His study was commissioned by the border city of McAllen,\nTexas, for presentation to the International Trade Commission\nwhich is gathering information for a report to Congress on what\nchanges may be needed in the U.S. tariff codes to prevent the\nloss of jobs and industry.\n    McAllen and other Texas border cities have benefitted from\na trend among U.S. companies to build twin plants that employ\nfactory workers on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n    More than 700 manufacturers are taking advantage of lenient\ntax codes that allow U.S. companies to bring raw goods into\nMexico for assembly by low-skilled workers into products that\nare completed by U.S. workers at a nearby sister plant.\n    Bolin said his research indicated that the shift in\nlow-paying jobs across the border reflected changing\ndemographics of the U.S. workforce.\n    \"In the post-baby boom era, fewer workers will be available\nto fill these low-skill jobs -- and these workers will be\nbetter educated than prior generations,\" Bolin told reporters in\nMcAllen.\n    \"The jobs in

The dollar opened here today at 144.90 yen.\n    MITI also said the so-called \"J-curve\" and the drop in oil\nprices together accounted for 33.2 billion dlrs of the 36.6\nbillion dlr rise in Japan's trade surplus last year.\n    On a customs cleared basis, the Japanese trade surplus rose\nto a record 82.66 billion dlrs last year.\n    The ministry said the fall in oil prices accounted for 16.5\nbillion dlrs and the \"J-curve\" 17.2 billion dlrs of the rise in\nthe 1986 surplus.\n    Analyzing the expansion in Japan's trade imbalance in\nrecent years, MITI calculated that 37 pct of it could be\naccounted for by exchange rates, 24 pct by differences in\neconomic growth rates between Japan and other countries, and 36\npct by so-called price elasticities of imports and exports.\n    Analyzing the expansion in the U.S. Trade deficit from 1982\nto 1985, the ministry said 24 pct was accounted for by exchange\nrates, 34 pct by differences in the income elasticity of\nimports and exports and 39 pct by differences in economic\ngrowth rates.

There will be 7.5 mln warrants in all,\nwith a term of 10 years.\n    The planned convertible preferred stock will carry a\ndividend rate equivalent to three months LIBOR plus an as yet\nundecided premium, the document said. There will be no sinking\nfund for the preferred stock, which will have 10-year warrants\nattached to buy BankAmerica common stock.\n    The rest of the details of the preferred stock issue have\nyet to be worked out.\n    On both the preferred stock and note issues, BankAmerica\nsaid that a fixed rate alternative was possible.\n    The document said that BankAmerica was also open to raising\nfunds in yen, if that was desirable for the Japanese.\n    Those present at the meeting today were working-level\nofficials from 13 city, three long-term credit and seven trust\nbanks, Japanese banking sources said.\n    Newman expressed hope that certain banks would act as lead\nmanagers of the projected debt securities but did not name\nspecific banks, the sources said. No bank made any commitment\nto the company's fund-raising plan as most knew little about it\nin advance, they said.\n    \"Today's meeting itself was held with very short-notice and\nwe just can't decide what to do with it,\" said a senior official\nat a leading city bank.\n    Newman attempted to quell Japanese bankers' fears that the\nU.S. Federal Reserve may insist that they deduct the equivalent\namount to the securities purchased  from their primary capital,\nunder a regulation now being studied by the U.S. And Britain.\n    Newman told them that they should not worry because he\nunderstood the U.S. Federal Reserve would not go along with\nsuch a regulation, the official said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 07:03:04.15","places":["japan"]},"18549":{"title":"CITIBANK LOWERS AUSTRALIAN PRIME RATE TO 16 PCT","body":"Citibank Ltd said it would lower its\nAustralian prime rate to 16 pct from 16.5, effective tomorrow.\n    The new rate, if unmatched by other banks, will be the\nlowest among Australian trading banks.

producing\ncountries.\n    The roasters said the positions were generally fairly\nclose, and problems with some Government officials.\n    Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of

Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains\nsubcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat\nand corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs\nand 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.\n    House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has\nsaid the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.\n    But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to\nbe approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and\na strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said\nfreezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major\ngrain export competitors and would not achieve the budget\nsavings Glickman claims.\n    Another area where Glickman and other have said budget\nsavings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,\nARP, levels for wheat and corn.\n    However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand\nwithin the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop\nwheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30\npct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most\ncommodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.\n    Congressional sources said the only way to achieve\nsignificant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost\nthe 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said\nsingling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as\nunfair to one commodity.\n    Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most\nlikely to eventually look for budget savings are some\ntightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible \nadoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.\n    Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion\nbut not enough, they said.\n    Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture\ncommittees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on\nall Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price\nsupport loans and deficiency payments, similar to the\nGramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.\n    This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau\nFederation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 08:59:19.40","topics":["grain","corn"],"places":["usa"]},"18615":{"title":"WOODSTREAM <WOD> REVIEWING STRATEGIC PLAN","body":"Woodstream Corp said its board will\nhold a special meeting on July 28 to review a \"strategic plan\"\ndeveloped by management.\n    It gave no details.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 08:59:23.04","places":["usa"]},"18616":{"title":"U.S. FIRST TIME JOBLESS CLAIMS ROSE IN WEEK","body":"New applications for unemployment\ninsurance benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 340,000 in the\nweek ended June 6 from 310,000 in the prior week, the Labor\nDepartment said.\n    The number of people actually receiving benefits under\nregular state programs totaled 2,359,000 in the week ended May\n30, the latest period for which that figure was available.\n    That was up from 2,255,000 the previous week.\n     \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 09:01:08.77","topics":["jobs"],"places":["usa"]},"18617":{"title":"AMERICAN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES <AIT> PAYOUT","body":"Qtly div 1.25 dlrs vs 1.25 dlrs prior\n    Pay Aug One\n    Record June 30\n    NOTE: American Information Technologies Corp.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 09:01:25.63","places":["usa"]},"18618":{"title":"INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS MASTER LP <INP> IN PAYOUT","body":"Qtly div 25 cts vs 25 cts prior\n    Pay July 10\n    Record June 30                                             \n    \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 09:03:47.74","places":["usa"]},"18619":{"title":"BELL ATLANTIC CORP <BEL> SETS QTLY DIVIDEND","body":"Qtly div 96 cts vs 96 cts prior\n    Pay August one\n    Record June 30\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 09:03:56.54","places":["usa"]},"18620":{"title":"ARAB MONETARY FUND LENDS IRAQ 71.7 MLN DLRS","body":"The Arab Monetary Fund is to lend Iraq\n71.7 mln dlrs to help to finance its trade with other Arab\ncountries, the United Arab Emirates news agency WAM said.\n    The first repayment on the loan will fall due in 30 months\nwith full repayment spread over four years.

But diminished\ncustomer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,\nmarketing incentives have helped their sales.\n    Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by\nmeans of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside\nbetter priced grades in a \"package.\"\n    Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least\nfor some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should\nchange prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for\nfuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At\nits last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed\nprices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference\npoint. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985\nwhen members offered discounts to attract customers.\n    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8\nmln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter\nand 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend\nor raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.\n    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not\nmirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr\ntarget and at most make minimal changes to differentials,\nanalysts say.\n    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one\nnon-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export\ncrudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.\nExtra heavy crudes were among those left out.\n    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil\nexports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say\nonly one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at\nofficial prices, with some of the rest included in processing\nor barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.\n    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,\nwhen some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to\npay the new prices.\n   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude\n-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --\nwas uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.\n    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below\nits 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,\ndue partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has\nrisen.\n    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say\nits price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.\n    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort\nGrieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the\ndifferentials question in Vienna.\n    \"It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which\nholds the presidency, raised the issue,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 09:05:26.27","topics":["crude"],"organisations":["opec"],"places":["uk","qatar","nigeria","iran","libya","saudi-arabia"]},"18622":{"title":"RYLAND GROUP INC <RYL> IN PAYOUT","body":"Qtly div 10 cts vs 10 cts prior\n    Pay July 30\n    Record July 15\n                                                 \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 09:07:37.56","places":["usa"]},"18623":{"title":"IPCO CORP <IHS> IN PAYOUT","body":"Qtly div nine cts vs nine cts prior\n    Pay July 31\n    Record July Nine\n                                                 \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 09:07:42.69","places":["usa"]},"18624":{"title":"SAXON OIL <SAXO.O> SETS REDUCTION IN STOCK","body":"Saxon Oil Co said stockholders at its\nrecent annual meeting approved, among other things, a 1-for 15\nreduction in the number of outstanding shares of common stock.\n    The company said stockholders also approved the reelection\nof the four directors of the company and the authorization of a\nchange in the state of incorporation of the company from Texas\nto Delaware.\n    Saxon said it will defer completion of the reincorporation\nand the reduction in shares pending satisfactory resolution of\ncertain federal income tax consequences of such actions.\n   \n    Also approved at the meeting was a proposal for\nindemnification agreements to be entered into with the\ndirectors and executive officers.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 09:09:17.91","places":["usa"]},"18625":{"title":"NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE","body":"Analysts said they were surprised at\nthe government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for\nfiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy\nstatements and positive for the economy.\n    Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus\nfor the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs\nagainst a 1.95 billion deficit last year.\n    Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus\nwas even more positive than the most bullish analysts'\nforecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.\n    Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters\nbefore the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a\n2.3 billion dlr deficit.

As\nlong as that continues we're okay,\" he added.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 10:13:26.02","topics":["interest","reserves","jobs","income"],"places":["uk"]},"18673":{"title":"CANADA PANEL REJECTS HYDRO QUEBEC BID FOR 3 BILLION DLR\nNEW ENGLAND POWER SALE\n","date":"18-JUN-1987 10:14:02.26"},"18674":{"title":"FED GOVERNOR SEGER SEES CURRENCY STABILITY","body":"Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha\nSeger said there were signs of helpful stability in foreign\nexchange markets in recent weeks.\n    \"I think we are beginning to see more calm in those markets,\"\nSeger told reporters after a speech to the U.S. League of\nSavings Institutions.\n    \"I think it is very healthy when you can get into a period\nof stability,\" she said.\n    She said market forces have a major influence on exchange\nrates and said she did not know the right value for the dollar\nagainst the Yen or the Mark.\n    Seger told the Savings and Loan executives that she was\nconcerned about financial markets' absorption with exchange\nrate influences.\n    \"I am concerned that we have gotten so nervous,\" about\nexchange rates, Seger said.\n    She said the Fed takes into account additional factors in\ndetermining monetary policy than the value of the dollar\nagainst other currencies.\n    On the economy, Seger called the latest figures in gross\nnational product a modest upward revision.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 10:15:17.31","topics":["money-fx"],"places":["usa"]},"18675":{"title":"GM LAYING OFF 850 HOURLY WORKERS TO CUT OUTPUT AT\nJANESVILLE AND LORDSTOWN PLANTS\n","date":"18-JUN-1987 10:16:54.05"},"18676":{"title":"INDONESIA/TURKEY ELIGIBLE FOR CATTLE UNDER EEP","body":"U.S. exporters will be able to sell\n8,000 head of dairy cattle to Indonesia and 5,000 head to\nTurkey under the Export Enhancement Program, the U.S.\nAgriculture Department said.\n    The export sales will be subsidized with commodities from\nthe inventory of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), the\ndepartment said.\n    Indonesia and Turkey already have purchased 7,500 and 5,000\nhead of dairy cattle, respectively, under the program.\n    Details of the program and an invitation for offers from\nexporters will be issued in the near future, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 10:18:19.28","topics":["livestock"],"places":["usa","indonesia","turkey"]},"18677":{"title":"COUPON FIXED AS INDICATED ON WACOAL WARRANT BOND","body":"The coupon on the 80 mln ECU, five year\nequity warrant eurobond for Japan's Wacoal Corp has been fixed\nat the indicated 1-1/2 pct, bookrunner Banque Paribas Capital\nMarkets said.\n    The exercise price was set at 1,323 yen per share,\nrepresenting a premium of 2.56 pct over today's closing price\nof 1,290 yen.

In March, the government said 1988 tax cuts\nwould be expanded by 5.2 billion marks to 13.7 billion.\n    A month later, economics minister Martin Bangemann\ncountered a joint call from all five German economic institutes\nto speed up tax cuts by saying such a step would endanger\nefforts to consolidate the budget and keep new public borrowing\ndown.\n    Financing the tax reform has become an \"acute problem,\" Ifo\nsaid.\n    \"Currently, every proposal over financing (the reform) comes\nup against political opposition. There will be a lot more\ncriticism before the outstanding 19.4 billion marks needed to\nfinance the reform has been accounted for,\" the report said.\n    The government has pledged to agree by the Autumn how to\nraise around 19 billion marks still needed to finance tax cuts.\nSubsidies paid to ailing industries are the major target.\n    But even leading coalition members like Matthias Wissmann,\neconomics spokesman for the ruling Christian Democratic party,\nhave conceded that subsidy cuts exceeding five billion marks\nare unrealistic, leaving a remaining 14 billion marks to be\nfound.\n    An increase in public borrowing will be inevitable to help\nfinance the tax cuts, but Bonn should be able to cope with\nthis, the report said.\n    Despite vigorous opposition from the Free Democrats, the\njunior partners in the centre-right coalition government, Bonn\nwill eventually be forced to increase value added tax (VAT) due\nto tax harmonisation measures within the European Community. A\nVAT increase will also provide funds for income tax reform, the\nreport said.\n    Viewed in the context of efforts by Bonn, Washington and\nTokyo to reform taxes, \"despite its various shortcomings, West\nGermany's planned tax reform is better than its reputation,\" Ifo\nsaid.\n    The effective cut in the income tax burden carried by West\nGermans will be greater than in the U.S., Although the rate\nreductions are smaller and income tax levels will remain higher\noverall, the report said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 11:22:33.59","places":["west-germany"]},"18732":{"title":"A.G.

Would justify asking consumers to\nmake an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem\nwithin that sector by paying a levy.\"\n    The proposed tax is necessary because the level of\nbudgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds\nproduction has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.\n    Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European\nCurrency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0\nbillion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's \"standstill\"\nagreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then\nfeel the full impact of its enlargement.\n    The Commission has proposed several cost and production\ncutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum\nguaranteed quantity system, he added.\n    Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer\nprices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700\nEcus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe\nsaid.\n    Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory\namount when market prices are below or above this level.\n    He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory\namount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural\nPolicy's oils and fats regime.\n    \"The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the\nproposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete\nor an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,\" he said.\n    Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.\n    It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied\nto domestic and imported products, and past experience showed\nit would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.\n    EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do\nunder present aid arrangements, he said.\n    The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC\nproduced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities\nimported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,\nTanghe said.\n    The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'\nrequirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall\neffect would stabilise Community production levels without\naffecting demand, he said.\n    It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current\nimport levels, he said.\n    Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are\nimported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals\nrequirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.\nFurthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported\nbeans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 11:35:48.30","topics":["veg-oil"],"organisations":["ec"],"places":["belgium","spain","portugal"]},"18745":{"title":"FECSA TO MEET DEBT NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE TUESDAY","body":"Officials of Fuerzas Electricas de\nCataluna S.A.

maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a\nyear in the next few years despite low world prices,\ndeteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry\nofficials said.\n    But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a tough\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has\nintroduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure\nthe ailing industry and boost profitability, they said.\n    Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia\nConsolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year\nended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a\nrecord 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes.\n    \"We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial\nyear, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due\nto greater availability of spares and equipment,\" a ZCCM\nofficial said.\n    ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another\nstrategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.\n    Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes\nhigher than the previous year and the best production achieved\nto date.\n    Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper\nindustry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Mining\nis monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the\ncountry's foreign exchange earnings.\n    Production has also been seriously affected in recent years\nby equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of\nspare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output\nlast year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.\n    A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984\nby ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African\nDevelopment Bank and the World Bank.\n    The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and\nmetallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.\n    ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has\nsaid it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as\npart of the plan.\n    More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the\nindustry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under\nthe five-year restructuring plan.\n    Company officials said although reserves were being\ndepleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the\nend of the century, though at lower levels of production.\n    Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for\nthe financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln\nkwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being\nlevied, a net loss is likely to be registered.\n    ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared\nwith a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.\n    Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in\n1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as\nthe value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over\ntwo to the dollar.\n    But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the\nauctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,\nand announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic\nstrategy based on national resources.\n    ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the\nbreak with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.\n    \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures will\naffect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare\nunder the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operations\nand third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.\n    Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange\nrate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export\nprofits.\n    \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even\npoint for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" Frederick\nChiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.\n    High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian\nindustry.\n    Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69\ncents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States\nand under 40 cents in Chile.\n    The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia\nbeing landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had\nstopped sBending copper south through South Africa.\n    Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are\nsent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while\n5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.\nTransport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and\nfuel.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 13:23:46.87","topics":["copper"],"organisations":["imf"],"places":["zambia"]},"18850":{"title":"EXCEL INDUSTRIES INC <EXC> DIVIDEND SET","body":"Qtly div nine cts vs nine cts prior\n    Pay July 20\n    Record July 6\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 13:23:50.02","places":["usa"]},"18851":{"title":"RIO DE JANEIRO DOCKERS STRIKE OVER WAGES","body":"Rio de Janeiro's 3,500\ndockworkers went on strike for an indefinite period today to\ndemand wage increases, a spokesman for the dockers said.\n    The Rio dockers did not get support from their colleagues\nin Santos, Brazil's main port, but the spokesman said they\nwould not return to work unless their demands were met.\n    Earlier this week, some 65,000 dockworkers cancelled a\nscheduled national strike to pressure port officials to give\nthem a wage increase and other benefits.\n    A Rio port spokesman said the halt would cause daily losses\nof about 100,000 U.S. dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 13:24:06.94","topics":["ship"],"places":["brazil"]},"18852":{"title":"FLUOR <FLR> WINS GENERAL ELECTRIC <GE> CONTRACT","body":"Fluor Corp said it won a contract\nwith General Electric to design, construct and deliver modules\nfor a methyl chloride process addition.\n    The value of the contract was not disclosed.\n    Fluor said its Applied Engineering Co unit will construct\n28 modular sections and deliver them to GE's Waterford, N.Y.\nSilicone Products division plant.\n    Methyl chloride is an integral part of silicone production.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 13:24:27.22","topics":["pet-chem"],"places":["usa"]},"18853":{"title":"SHAWMUT <SHAS.O> REPURCHASES 400,000 SHARES","body":"Shawmut Corp said it has repurchased\n400,000 common shares and placed them in its treasury.\n    The company has about 16.1 mln shares outstanding.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 13:27:05.54","places":["usa"]},"18854":{"title":" LITTLE PRINCE <LTLP.O> SETTLES SUIT","body":"Little Prince Productions Ltd said it\nsettled litigation with Nederlander Group, receiving one mln\ndlrs and paying Nederlander 38,000 dlrs.\n                    \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-JUN-1987 13:27:16.26","places":["usa"]},"18855":{"title":"CONT'L ILLINOIS <CIL> CANNOT EXPLAIN STOCK MOVE","body":"Continental Illinois Corp said it knows\nof know reason why its stock was trading higher in heavy\nvolume.\n    The stock was up 1/2 to 5-3/8 on turnover of 1,386,000\nshares, making it one of the most actively traded NYSE issues.\n    Traders earlier said Goldman Sachs and Co was trading on\nthe stock.

will\ncontribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.\n    As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5\npct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,\nthe Bank of America economist who wrote the report.\n    \"Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop\ndramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause\na falloff in the growth

Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in\nNovember not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.\n    \"I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and\nmore interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands\nto make a ton of money,\" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson\nLehman Brothers Inc. \"In play\" is a term used on Wall Street to\ndescribe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling\ntakeover target.\n    Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon\ngets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through\nNovember of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per\nshare. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of\nthree yesterday.\n    The agreement would be calculated on the basis of\nPerelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a\nsplit. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other\ncompany at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262\nmln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen\nreturned telephone calls seeking comment.\n    \"Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if\nsomeone else takes over Gillette,\" said Analyst Deepak Raj of\nMerrill Lynch and Co. \"I'm not saying that is going to happen\nbut Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45\ndlrs per share.\"\n    Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons\nwhy Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring\nGillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon\nprivate after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two\nyears ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's\noperations. \"He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of\nthe dearptment store business.\" Another reason is that Revlon\nhas recently made two other acquisitions.\n    Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if\nsome company such as Unilever plc <UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble\nCo <PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.\n    Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for\nGillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc <HAN>,\nRJR Nabisco Inc <RJR>, American Brands Inc <AMB> and Ralston\nPurina Co <RAL>.\n    \"Perelman is trying to put the company in play,\" said a\nWall Street arbitrageur. \"He gets to share in the upside if the\ncompany is sold.\" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette\nto resist Perelman's overture. \"I can't see the board\nconsenting, what has changed between November and now,\" he\nsaid.\n   \n    Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.\n\"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of\ncalculation,\" he said. But he added, \"The Gillette board has to\nbe careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by\nshareholders.\" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,\nthree and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.\n    According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by\nGillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger\nagreement without any financing condition.
