The shares climbed 3-3/8 to 31-3/8 by midday.\nVoytko said profit-taking pressure could become severe at the\n35 dlr level. Others say Conrail, a combination of previously\nbankrupt railroads, has good long term potential.\n    \"Conrail is in the best position to weather the current\ntremendous price competition in the transportation industry in\ngeneral,\" said Drew Robertson, analyst at Atlantic Systems Inc,\na research firm.\n    \"It will survive and do damn well,\" said another analyst\nwho declined to be identified. He noted that Conrail's freight\ntrains serve heavy industry including steel and autos in major\nU.S. cities in the northeast U.S. and midwest.\n    Robertson noted that Conrail's traffic is less dependent on\ncoal than other railroads based in the east. He expects Conrail\nto earn 2.85 dlrs per share in 1987.\n    Voytko of PaineWebber sees another problem six months down\nthe road when more than 10 mln Conrail shares will be\ndistributed to current and former employees.

He doubts it would\ncreate a big downward push on the price.\n    \"It's hard to call,\" said the analyst who requested\nanonymity. In some cases employe loyalty may motivate\nindividuals to keep their shares, he said.\n    Steven Lewins, analyst for Citicorp Investment Management,\nbelieves the key to Conrail's long term outlook is how it is\nable to invest surplus cash. He expects Conrail to earn 3.00\ndlrs per share this year, flat in comparison with 1986, but by\n1991 the picture could change dramatically if money not needed\nfor rail operations is invested wisely.\n    By 1991, earnings could reach 4.30 dlrs per share, Lewins\nsaid, factoring in reinvestment of free cash flow at\nconservative rates.\n    He believes motor freight will be one area of\ndiversification Conrail will explore.\n    Elizabeth Dole, U.S. Secretary of Transportation, whose\ndepartment was responsible for the sale of Conrail, noted that\nConrail is required to reinvest in its rail system and cannot\ndefer necessary maintenance.\n    For the historic offering of Conrail shares, Dole visited\nthe New York Stock Exchange and was photographed on the floor\nwearing a locomotive engineer's cap, which she presented to\nStanley Crane, Conrail chairman and chief executive.\n    The U.S. government is expected to receive about 1.88\nbillion dlrs for Conrail after factoring in underwriting fees\nand other adjustments.\n    The possibility of a recession at some time in the next\nfive years is another issue troubling some investors.\n    Lewins says revenue-ton-miles, which he believes will climb\nfrom 68.7 mln miles last year to 69.5 mln this year and 70.5\nmln in 1988, will grow to 71.5 mln in 1991, but in a recession\nyear, perhaps 1989, the figure could dip to 64.2 mln.\n    On the revenue side, he believes revenue per ton-mile will\nbe 4.7 cts in 1991, little changed from present levels and\nexactly the same as in 1981.\n    \"Their basic business isn't going anywhere,\" he says,\nexplaining why emphasizes investment of cash flow.\n    Voytko thinks Conrail can remain profitable in a recession\nyear. He points out his firm, PaineWebber, is not forecasting a\nrecession in any specific year, but as an example a 1990\nrecession of modest degree could knock earnings down to 2.20\ndlrs per share. He estimated 3.00 dlrs per share this year and\n3.35 dlrs next year. His 1988 figure reflects mostly a lowering\nof the tax rate to 34 pct from 40 pct this year.\n    Voytko believes the Conrail shares merit purchase at the 26\ndlr level.\n    Goldman, Sachs and Co was lead manager for the offering.

Trading\nCorp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).\n    \"The two state trading corporations are free to use their\nbuying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian\nexports,\" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that\nprivate firms are excluded from countertrading.\n    One trade source said India has targetted countries that\ndepend on an Indian

the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade\nduring the nine months ended December, the sources said.\n    Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65\nbillion dlrs in trade during fiscal

worried,\ndespite growing anti-Japanese protectionism, a soaring yen, and\na stagnant world electronics market.\n    \"The company's structure was developed by looking ahead,\"\nTadahiro Sekimoto told Reuters in an interview.\n    \"We assumed the era of a strong yen, trade friction and\nglobalisation would arrive, and we moved ahead on that basis.\nThere's no need to change our strategy now.\"\n    However, the world's largest manufacturer of microchips,\nthe tiny silicon wafers which are the brains of most high\ntechnology products, knows it must keep looking ahead if it is\nto survive.\n    Hoping to build on existing strengths, NEC is now turning\nits focus on home electronics, an area of past weakness,\nSekimoto said.\n    NEC wants to follow its corporate slogan \"C and C\" (Computers\nand Communications) to create high level home electronics that\ngo beyond mere televisions and video tape recorders, Sekimoto\nsaid.\n    Home electronics accounted for only eight pct of NEC's\ntotal 2,334.67 billion yen sales on a consolidated basis in the\nyear ended March 31, 1986.\n    Industry analysts say NEC is wise to target what will be a\nmajor growth market in the future, but some warn the company\nfaces some stiff competition.\n    \"This is where the market is going to be for a long time --\nin products that combine personal computers, video display and\ntelecommunications networks,\" said Salomon Brothers (Asia) Ltd\nanalyst Carole Ryavec. \"But Matsushita (Electric Industrial Co\nLtd) may be there first.\"\n    But Sekimoto argues that NEC's overall strengths will carry\nthe day.\n    \"Many companies are in the top 10 in computers or microchips\nor telecommunications, but none is in the top 10 in all three.\nNEC is unique in that respect,\" he said.\n    To help its already high rankings, NEC will further\nincrease the high level of offshore production which makes it\none of the most multinational of Japan's electronics firms.\n    The company will increase offshore output of all goods it\nsells overseas to 50 pct from a current 25 pct over the next\nseveral years, Sekimoto said.\n    But the firm plans to go it alone in expanding overseas,\ndespite moving last year to become joint owner, along with\nFrance's Cie des Machines Bull <BULP.P>, of U.S. Firm Honeywell\nInc's <HON> Information Systems unit.\n    \"We hope to increase our share in the U.S. Market through\nthe Honeywell tie-up. But our basic strategy is to take an\nindependent and autonomous route,\" said Sekimoto.\n    The company also plans to maintain its independent line by\ncontinuing to make computers which are not compatible with\nthose of International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, he said.\n    \"Among the Japanese competitors, only NEC hasn't been caught\nin software copyright disputes with IBM and our profits and\nmarket share have gradually expanded,\" Sekimoto said.\n    Once new ways of linking non-compatible computers are\nperfected, IBM compatibility will be irrelevant. \"What will\nmatter is the best hardware, the best software and the best\nability to meet customers needs,\" Sekimoto said.\n    In fact, NEC, which has over half of Japan's personal\ncomputer market, may go to court to stop competitors selling\ncheaper machines which can run NEC software but infringe\ncopyright on its operating system, an NEC spokesman said.\n    While industry analysts give NEC high marks for looking\nahead, they note that it failed in forecasting microchip\ndemand. Like other Japanese chipmakers, the firm was left with\nserious excess capacity when lean years followed the boom\ntimes.\n    But after two years of cutbacks in capital investment in\nthe sector, Sekimoto thinks the time has come to boost spending\nagain, if only slightly.\n    \"We're not going to increase production. But we are going to\ninvest in new product development and upgrade existing plant,\"\nhe said.\n    Despite NEC's admitted strengths, analysts note the company\nfaces tough times due to stagnant markets.\n    \"NEC has excellent worldwide capacity and technology, but\nthey are caught in a downturn which may last a long time,\" said\nSalamon's Ryavec.\n    The company forecasts such troubles will slash parent net\nprofits to 30 billion yen in the year ending March 31, 1987,\ndown 43 pct from the previous year, although sales are expected\nto rise eight pct to 2,130 billion yen.\n    Profits will improve only slightly next year, rising to 38\nbillion yen on sales of 2,350 billion, it said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 26-MAR-1987 23:52:19.47","places":["japan"]},"10279":{"title":"JAPAN ADOPTS STOP-GAP BUDGET","body":"The government adopted an 8,829 billion\nyen stop-gap budget for fiscal 1987 starting April 1 to\ncompensate for the delay in the passage through the Parliament\nof the full 1987/88 budget.\n    The provisional budget includes 1,862 billion yen in public\nworks spending to help stimulate the economy and meet overseas\ndemand for Japan to import more and reduce its huge trade\nsurplus, officials said.\n    They said the stop-gap budget will be in effect for 50 days\nthrough May 20 and is the largest ever.\n    The budget includes 1,580 billion yen in new government\nbond issues.\n    Officials said the spending on public works accounts for\nabout two-sevenths of the 6,017 billion yen in public works\noutlay set aside in the pending formal 1987/88 budget.\n    The planned full budget totals 54,101 billion yen.\n    The government had to work out the stop-gap budget because\nbudget debates have been delayed by an opposition boycott of\nParliamentary business in protest against a planned five pct\nsales tax.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"27-MAR-1987 00:02:59.13\u0005\u0005\u0005RM","places":["japan"]},"10280":{"title":"JARDINE MATHESON HOLDINGS LTD <JARD.HKG> YEAR 1986","body":"Shr 126 H.K.

\"As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new\nagreement which would revive world prices,\" Yulo said.\n    \"If there is no agreement world prices will always be\ndepressed,

It regards a\nstable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate\npolicies to influence the exchange rate.\n    The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate\naims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands.\n    Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.\n    Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: \"By\nmaintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the\nexpectation it will always intervene above that level. If it\nsuddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to\nobtain.\"\n    Amro's Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest\nrates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of\nsecurities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital\nmarket. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring\nabout small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he\nadded.\n    Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is\na price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central\nBank's policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters,\nnoting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with\nthe mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency.\n    \"It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference\nbetween West Germany to maintain the exchange rate,\" he added.\n    Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the\nNetherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows\nbetween the two countries, as the economic performance of the\ntwo does not differ much, economists said.\n    Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the\nNetherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they\naccounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two\ncountries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the\nDutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month.\n    Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest\nand exchange rates.\n    West Germany is the Netherlands' largest single trading\npartner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of\nimports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of\nStatistics figures show.\n    At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits\ntrade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a\nrate of around 5-7/16 pct.\n    Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will\neven rise further because of expectations of deflation here in\n1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany.\n    In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to\ndecrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch\nCentral Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.\nGerman GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation\nbetween zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts.\n    But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money\ndealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates\nindependently without prior moves by the Bundesbank.\n    Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22,\nthe Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5\npct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit\nsurcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had\nexpected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.\n    The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact\non the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.\n    While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its\npolicies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range\nnarrow.\n    \"The European Monetary System is not only a relationship\nbetween the guilder and the mark.

By January, its estimate of 1986\nplanted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.\n    Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in\n1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good\ndemand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts\nsaid those factors make cotton a profitable crop.\n    \"With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is\ngoing to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton.\nSoybeans are dirt cheap,\" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill\nInvestor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton\nmarket specialists.\n    Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to\nincreased acreage, analysts said.\n    They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers\nwho used part of their crop as collateral for government loans\nwere not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in\ngovernment warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government\nwill not pick up the tab for storage.\n    Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from\nparticipating in the program, which could result in more\ncotton. \"The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of\n25 pct of a farmer's base acreage,\" noted Judy Weissman of\nShearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to\nparticipate in the program are free to plant all the acreage \nthey have.\n    Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding\nWestern states would be most likely to steer clear of the\nprogram. \"Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,\" said\none commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part\non forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its\nannual meeting in late January.\n    But others disagreed. \"I think some Western growers have\ndecided they should be in the program for security reasons.\nThere's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed the\ngovernment's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the\nprogram is subject to the wiles of the market,\" said Walter\nBrown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer.\n    Some cotton specialists said their expectations for\nincreased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's planting\nintentions report. \"Anything the USDA is announcing now is\nbased on information they gathered before their cotton program\nwas announced (on March 20),\" one analyst cautioned. She said\ntraders will get a better idea of next year's cotton output\nwhen the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9.\n    Brown took that opinion a step further. \"I don't think\nplanted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment\nrate,\" the difference between acreage planted and acreage\nharvested.\n    Brown said the abandonment rate this year was \"pretty high\"\nat 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing\nstates. \"More normal would be about six pct,\" he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"27-MAR-1987 12:25:34.63\u0005\u0005\u0005C G","topics":["cotton"],"places":["usa"]},"10538":{"title":"IMATRON INC <IMAT> 4TH QTR LOSS","body":"Shr loss 16 cts vs loss seven cts\n    Net loss 3,450,000 vs loss 1,508,000\n    Sales 56,000 vs 1,187,000\n    Avg shrs 22,568,000 vs 20,591,000\n    Year\n    Shr loss 38 cts vs loss 29 cts\n    Net loss 7,977,000 vs loss 6,005,000\n    Sales 3,699,000 vs 2,391,000\n    Avg shrs 21,111,000 vs 20,578,000\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"27-MAR-1987 12:25:58.66\u0005\u0005\u0005F","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"10539":{"title":"NATO CALLS ON GREECE AND TURKEY TO AVOID FORCE","body":"Greece and Turkey's NATO allies today\ncalled on both countries to avoid any action that could\naggravate an explosive situation in the Aegean and \"avoid\nrecourse to force at all costs.\"\n    After an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors, a statement\nwas issued saying \"the present situation damages the interests\nof Greece and Turkey, and of the Alliance as a whole.\"\n    Secretary-General Lord Carrington also offered himself as a\nmediator in the dispute on the Western Alliance's southern\nflank.\n    The meeting was called after reports that warships of both\ncountries were sailing towards a disputed oil exploration zone\nof the Aegean.\n    The statement said the tensions in the area had reached a\nserious level and called on both countries to begin immediate\ndiscussions. \"Any intensification would make things worse,\" it\nadded.\n    No attempt was made at the meeting to resolve the complex\ndispute which was aimed at damage-limitation.

The other reforms, which address dual trading,\nwould apply only to the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index\nfutures pit.\n    A debate over dual trading, the practice of trading for\none's own account and filling customer orders, has arisen\nbecause many traders believe it can create a climate for\ntrading abuses, especially in the extremely volatile stock\nindex futures pit.\n    Adoption of the Board of Governors' reforms hinges on an\nApril 13 vote of CME members on a membership petition, signed\nby several hundred members in February, that would bar all dual\ntrading at the exchange.\n    Defeat of the petition is likely, according to a floor\nbroker contacted by Reuters, who also said he welcomed the\nlimits on the \"ring\" traders.

At present pre-market trading is almost\nexclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be\ndone during the sterling rings, they added.\n    LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more\nclosely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the\nrecent wide backwardations.\n    Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct\npurity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc\ncountries, such as Romania.\n    The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined\nas an exporter recently, they said.\n    Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from\nliquidity problems initially, as business may continue to\ncentre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where\nthere are many holders of large short positions on the LME.\n    But others said the new contract would soon attract trading\ninterest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been\nattracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations.\n    The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a\nnew contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where\nhigh grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they\nsaid.\n    Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will\neventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like\nstandard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract,\ngob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process\nin this case may take longer, they added.\n    Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore\nwarehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations,\nwhich make physical trading difficult, would not totally\ndisappear as a result, the trade sources said.\n    These premiums for prompt metal have become a\nsemi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased\nbusiness and volatility in traded options, and are presently\naround 50 stg.\n    Increasingly large granting of option positions has been\ntaking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at\nthe end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes\naround these dates are commonplace, they said.\n    Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern\noperators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of\nhaving to cover.\n    But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even\nthough the LME's new option contracts widen the gap between the\ndeclaration and prompt dates.\n    These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of the\nmonth, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th.\n    Backwardations will remain while operators continue to\ngrant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds\naluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"27-MAR-1987 13:53:00.39\u0005\u0005\u0005C M","topics":["alum"],"places":["uk","singapore"]},"10594":{"title":"CANADIAN MONEY SUPPLY FALLS IN WEEK","body":"Canadian narrowly defined money supply\nM-1 fell 555 mln dlrs to 32.42 billion dlrs in week ended March\n18, Bank of Canada said.\n    M-1-A, which is M-1 plus daily interest chequable and\nnon-personal deposits, fell 559 mln dlrs to 74.86 billion dlrs\nand M-2, which is M-1-A plus other notice and personal\nfixed-term deposit fell 439 mln dlrs to 177.30 billion dlrs.\n    M-3, which is non-personal fixed term deposits and foreign\ncurrency deposits of residents booked at chartered banks in\nCanada, fell 696 mln dlrs to 215.74 billion dlrs.

Banker said the dollar\nwas likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an\nimprovement in the huge American trade deficit would be only\ntemporary at current world exchange rate levels.\n    Kurt Viermetz, Worldwide Treasurer of <Morgan Guaranty\nTrust Co>, told Arab currency traders meeting here that the\nsteady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to\nrein in U.S. Deficits on a lasting basis.\n    Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the Interarab\nCambist Association, Viermetz said an agreement reached last\nmonth among major industrial nations to steady the dollar\naround current levels left many questions unanswered.\n    \"I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround (rise) in the\ndollar,\" Viermetz said. \"I believe there is room for a further\nfall of five to 10 per cent in 1987.\"\n    The United States, West Germany, Japan, France, Great\nBritain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late February\nto stabilise major currencies around current levels.\n    The accord came after months of transatlantic argument,\nwith Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washington's policy of talking the\ndollar lower had made life impossible for West German and\nJapanese exporters.\n    The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continued\nslide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York in\nSeptember 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the\nvalue of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances.\n    But Viermetz said Morgan Guaranty's economic models showed\nthat with no further change in exchange rates -- and continued\nsluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the U.S. Trade\ndeficit would improve only temporarily.\n    He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this\nyear from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120\nbillion in 1988 but by 1990, it would be back around 160\nbillion dlrs.\n    \"This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities\nand politicians in Washington,\" he said.\n    Viermetz said it was only natural that markets should\nattempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord, struck\nwhen the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen.\n    Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or\n\"Plaza Accord,\" the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240\nyen.\n    Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted to\nsee the dollar hold within a \"loose range\" of 1.75 to 1.90 marks\nand 145 to 155 yen, with any attempt to push the U.S. Currency\nlower being countered by central bank intervention.\n    The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 147.15/25 yen --\nits lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40\nyears. It closed at 1.8160/70 marks.\n    Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds\nrate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an\nuncontrolled fall in the dollar.\n    But at the same time, worries about the international debt\ncrisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4\npct since this would increase loan costs to the third world.\n    The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together\nmore than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab\nworld and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres.\n    Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred on\nthe role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankers\nurging them to adapt to a new global trend towards\nsecuritisation of  business.\n    Hikmat Nashashibi,

It recommended that to stop friction\ndue to its large trade surpluses, Japan must \"make a historical\ntransformation in its traditional policies on economic\nmanagement and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further\ndevelopment for Japan without this transformation.\"\n    Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have\nlooked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the\nJapanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term\nprospects of totally transforming their economic habits.\n    The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese\nprevarication burst last week.

In February, EC Industrial\nPolicy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said \"I\nonly know that your government, under the leadership of\nMaekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less\noutward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa\nreport which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\"\n    And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better\nanswer than protectionism would be structural change within the\nJapanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And\nwe hope to see changes occur in the near future,\" visiting\nChairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.\n    Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the\nfault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of\nchange in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.\n    Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business\nleaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade\nproblem.\n    \"We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the\nMaekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,\"\nsaid EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.\n    \"The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it\nis finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their\nlabour,\" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of\nShearson Lehman Brothers.\n    Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.\n    Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as\nfast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled\nthe country asking about this issue.\n    He said People mentioned many things in line with the\nspirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and\nsteel industries.\n    A major misunderstanding is that the private report was\ngovernment policy.

It had called\nfor substantial new commercial bank lending and development\nbank aid in order to help debtor countries grow out of their\neconomic troubles.\n    The PINs provide a mechanism to finance the growth needed\nby these debtor nations, provided they are willing to welcome\nforeign equity investment into their economies, Ongpin told a\nbusinessmen's meeting. \"And this can now be achieved without\nforcing commercial banks into involuntary new money lending.\"\n    Bankers in New York said given the booming market in\ndebt-equity swaps, PINs ought to work if Manila issues the\nnotes at an appropriate discount.\n    Ongpin said the use of PINs would result in anticipated\nsavings of one billion pesos over the debt agreement's 17-year\nlife.\n    The accord restructured 5.8 billion dlrs of previously\nrescheduled debt, 3.5 billion dlrs of debt falling due between\nJanuary 1987 and December 1992, and 925 mln dlrs of new money\nlent by the banks in 1985 at a spread of 7/8 percentage points\nover London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).\n    It also rolled over trade credits worth 2.9 billion dlrs.\n    Ongpin said the Philippines' 7-1/2 year grace period was\nbetter than Mexico's seven-year grace period, while the PINs\nproposal would result in savings of foreign exchange and\ngenerate pesos which would be reinvested in domestic\nenterprises.\n    Ongpin said the restructuring of commercial bank debt, as\nwell as of 870 mln dlrs of debt by the Paris Club of Western\ncreditor governments in January, was expected to reduce the\ncountry's debt-service ratio to between 25 and 30 pct from its\ncurrent level of 40 to 45 pct.\n    He said the country's balance of payments was now projected\nat a surplus of about 1.2 billion dlrs in 1987, compared with a\nsurplus of about 1.1 billion dlrs in 1986 and a previous\nprojected deficit of 1.2 billion dlrs this year.\n    The Philippine negotiating team refined the PINs idea three\ntimes before the final agreement was struck last Friday, Ongpin\nsaid. \"What we have now is PINs IV,\" he said.\n    Ongpin told the meeting he had kept his promise to gain\nterms better than those granted last year to Mexico, which won\na 20-year repayment at 13/16 points over LIBOR.\n    \"And they (Mexico) are a long way from seeing any money\ncross the table even as of today,\" Ongpin said, adding he\nexpected much quicker approval from all the Philippines' 483\ncreditor banks worldwide.\n    He said he had been in almost daily telephone contact with\nPresident Corazon Aquino, particularly when the banks began to\ntake a very tough stance on pricing.\n    \"But the President's instructions were unequivocal and\nunwavering, 'Do not yield one more millimetre and I don't care\nhow long it takes.

It is the Maekawa\nreport which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\"\n    And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better\nanswer than protectionism would be structural change within the\nJapanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And\nwe hope to see changes occur in the near future,\" visiting\nChairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.\n    Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the\nfault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of\nchange in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.\n    Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business\nleaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade\nproblem.\n    \"We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the\nMaekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,\"\nsaid EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.\n    \"The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it\nis finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their\nlabour,\" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of\nShearson Lehman Brothers.\n    Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.\n    Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as\nfast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled\nthe country asking about this issue.\n    He said People mentioned many things in line with the\nspirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and\nsteel industries.\n    A major misunderstanding is that the private report was\ngovernment policy.

Sibson said he expects the tighter entrance\nrequirements to pare 3he current list of 67 members down by six\nto 10 members.\n    Smaller firms have criticized IPMA's efforts to restrict\nmembership to the larger firms, saying it is anti-competitive\nand that it reinforces the big firms' already large market\nshare.\n    \"Belonging to IPMA carries a certain amount of prestige with\nborrowers,\" said a dealer at a small foreign bank. \"The borrower\nsays to himself, \"Well I can travel economy or I can travel\nfirst class,'\" he said.\n    Sibson defended the new rules saying \"We have to steer a\ncourse between representing the interests of the major market\nmakers and the less desirable goal of representing everybody.\"\n    In any event, he said, the size of the market has expanded\nto the point where the former minimum size requirements were\njust too small.\n    Also, IPMA members will be required to register with the\nAssociation of International Bond Dealers as reporting dealers,\nsubmitting daily information on prices on issues in which they\nare market makers. The effective date of the rule has yet to be\ndetermined.\n    Dealers said that the rule would enable investors and\nsecondary market makers to better evaluate the appropriate\nmarket price for their securities. Such a rule would make\ninvestors more confident of trading in the eurobond market and\nwould increase liquidity, they said.\n    Dealers said that the form of the reporting has not yet\nbeen spelled out. But previous discussion of the reporting\nrequirement considered firms listing the closing price of a\ngiven security as well as the high and low for the day.\n     Members also agreed at the IPMA meeting on the\nimplementation of a new communications system which enables a\nlead manager to invite all potential management group members\nin to a deal at the same time.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"30-MAR-1987 11:39:42.85","places":["uk"]},"10855":{"title":"INTERNATIONAL PROTEINS CORP <PRO> YEAR NET","body":"Oper shr 49 cts vs 22 cts\n    Oper net 1,018,000 vs 468,000\n    Sales 95.0 mln vs 98.3 mln\n    NOTE: Net excludes tax credits of 284,000 dlrs vs 310,000\ndlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"30-MAR-1987 11:40:02.08","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"10856":{"title":"CSM SYSTEMS INC <CSMS> YEAR ENDED DEC 31 LOSS","body":"Shr loss 20 cts vs profit 24 cts\n    Net loss 173,578 vs profit 211,324\n    Revs 4,558,244 vs 5,595,644\n    NOTE: Earnings per share restated retroactively for all\nperiods to reflect 20 pct stock dividend in April 1984 and 25\npct stock split September 1985.\n    Revenues include progress receivables on long-term\ncontracts not billed to customers, and reflect the\nproportionate elements of profit as revenues based on stage of\ncompletion of long term contracts.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"30-MAR-1987 11:40:12.66","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"10857":{"title":"Ia-So Minn direct hogs estimated rcpts 95,000 vs actual week ago 93,000 and actual year ago 93,000.\n","date":"30-MAR-1987 11:40:35.66","topics":["hog","livestock"]},"10858":{"title":"BAXTER <BAX> STARTS CLINICAL TRIALS ON DRUG","body":"Baxter Travenol Laboratories\nsaid its Hyland Therapeutics unit has started the first human\nclinical trials on genetically engineered Factor VIII, the\nclotting agent missing from the blood of most hemophiliacs.\n    It said unlike Factor VIII concentrates currently in use,\ngenetically engineered Factor VIII would not be limited by the\navailability of human plasma and will be completely free from\nblood-borne viruses, including AIDS and all forms of hepatitis,\nBaxter said.\n    Baxter also said it is in the final states of U.S. clinical\ntrials on a highly purified form of Factor VIII derived from\nhuman plasma that is produced using an advanced process\nincorporating monoclonal antibody purification.\n    It said Genetics Institute, a publicly held biotechnology\ncompany in which Baxter is a shareholder, will supply the\nprotein used for human clinical testing, as well as a\nsubstantial portion of ongoing production requirements.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"30-MAR-1987 11:41:36.82","places":["usa"]},"10859":{"title":"FED SETS TWO BILLION DLR CUSTOMER REPURCHASE, FED SAYS\n","date":"30-MAR-1987 11:42:00.65","topics":["money-fx"]},"10860":{"title":"GLOBAL RAISES HEAVY FUELS PRICES","body":"Global Petroleum Corp said today it\nraised its posted prices for numbers six fuel cargoes in the\nnew york harbor 70 cts to 1.60 dlrs per barrel, depending on\ngrade.\n    Effective today, the new prices are: 0.3 pct sulphur 22.50\ndlrs, up 1.25; 0.5 pct sulphur 21.85 dlrs, up 1.60; one pct\nsulphur 20.10 dlrs, up 70 cts; two pct sulphur 19.85, up 75\ncts; 2.2 pct sulphur 19.25 dlrs, up 90 cts; 2.5 pct sulphur\n18.80 dlrs, up 1.20, the company said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"30-MAR-1987 11:42:10.54","topics":["fuel"],"places":["usa"]},"10861":{"title":"LONDON'S FTSE 100 FALLS BY LARGEST EVER MARGIN","body":"The Financial Times/Stock Exchange index\nof Britain's 100 leading shares fell by its largest ever margin\nin points terms during a single session, dropping 46.1 to close\nat 2,002.5.

Its surplus rose to 8.14\nbillion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.\n    Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade\ndeficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to\nthe dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to\npress Japan to buy more U.S. goods.\n    They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration\nin U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.\n    In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.\nsemiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he\nintended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese\nelectronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by\na 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.\n    Congress also has been been angered by the administration's\nlack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues\nincluding beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications\ngoods, and financial services.\n    The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in\nfour committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and\nmeasures to force the administration take tough action against\nforeign trade barriers and unfair competition.\n    Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many\ncases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese\nproducts or make them more expensive with higher duties.\n    The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House\nWays and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to\nforce President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign\ncompetition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win\ntemporary relief from surges in imports.\n    The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict\nimports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not\nbuy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.\n    Rep.

The\npurpose of that meeting will be to consider a resolution to the\narrears on the trade debt and the promissory notes.\n    Nigeria missed the first principal payment due on the notes\nlast autumn and another payment of about 30 mln dlrs that was\ndue in early January because of a cash shortage, which stemmed\npartly from the drop in oil prices last year.\n    An official of the Law Debenture Trust said he did not know\nwhen the new representative for the noteholders, David Murison,\nwould meet the Nigerians.

The initial rate was also to be initially set on\nApril 15, and quarterly after that, at 340 basis points below\nthe same 90-day New Zealand rate.\n    Because the Dow Chemical notes carried an interest rate\nfloor of 17 pct, the issue saw strong investor demand,\nunderwriters said.\n    But the Ford Credit notes and Friday's offering of 130 mln\nNew Zealand dlrs of floating-rate notes due 1990 issued by\nGeneral Electric Co's <GE> General Electric Credit Corp via\nPrudential-Bache Securities Inc, did not have such a floor.\n    \"Obviously, the two firms did not want to issue floaters\nand face the risk of New Zealand rates falling sharply,\" an\nunderwriter away from the syndicates said. He and others noted\nthat the New Zealand 90-day rate was 27 pct late last week.\n    An underwriter familiar with the Dow Chemical deal pointed\nout that because of the interest rate and currency swaps Dow\ndid, the issuer felt comfortable setting a rate floor.\n    Domestic offerings of foreign currency denominated date\nfirst surfaced in Fall 1985. By using currency and rate swaps,\ncompanies can sell debt that pays a high interest rate in a\nforeign currency like Australian or New Zealand dollars. But\nthe issuers actually realize savings on borrowing costs.\n    \"I would say that every company which issued foreign\ncurrency debt saved some basis points when compared to\nsame-maturity plain vanilla U.S. issues,\" an analyst said.\n    Investors, mainly institutions, were attracted to the early\nissues because of the high interest rates. They were willing to\nabsorb foreign currency risk until mid-1986, when sharp slides\nposted by the Australian and New Zealand dollars brought such\nissuance to a quick halt.\n    It was not until late last year, after the currencies\nstabilized, that companies again started issuing debt\ndenominated in Australian and New Zealand dollars.\n    But many investors have still shied away from the debt,\nremembering the mid-1986 downturn of the Australian and New\nZealand dollars, analysts noted.\n    To attract some of those investors back to the fold,\nunderwriters like Bear Stearns decided to structure the foreign\ncurrency issues as floating rate debt, sources said.\n    This occurred against a backdrop of uncertainty over the\ncourse of U.S. interest rates for the intermediate term, and\npredictions by a number of economists that Treasury yields\nwould rise in the second half of the year, the sources noted.\n    A Bear Stearns officer said more than half of the Ford\nCredit notes were sold by late Friday afternoon, the second day\nof offering. \"That is quicker than some recent fixed-rate New\nZealand dollar note issues,\" he said.\n    However, underwriters away from the Bear Stearns syndicate\nsaid the issue may have sold even faster if Prudential-Bache\ndid not offer the General Electric Credit notes on Friday.\n    They pointed out that the Ford notes were rated A-1 by\nMoody's Investors and AA-minus by Standard and Poor's, while\nthe General Electric notes, which had the same interest rate\nterms and were also non-callable to maturity, carried\ntop-flight AAA ratings by both agencies.\n    \"We have sold 20 to 25 pct of the GE notes.

He said over the\nweekend, investors pondered President Reagan's decision to\nimpose tariffs on Japanese electronic goods and some concluded\nthe step could signal the beginning of a trade war.\n    The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 79 points in 30\nminutes before stabilizing and making a partial recovery.\n    Korth believes there has been an over-reaction and\nnear-term traders might want to step in and buy one-half or\none-quarter of new investments they have been considering.\n    \"We're still in a bull market,\" said William Raftery of\nSmith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. He thinks history has shown\nsuch sharp pullbacks are a natural part of bull markets. \"The\nbear usually strikes slowly,\" he said.\n    Raftery noted that blue chips have been forefront of the\nrally that took the market to record highs last week. In\ntoday's decline, he said, the big name stocks were coming more\ninto a more normal alignment with the general market.\n    Charles Comer of Moseley Securities Corp said ultimately\nthe pullback could prove to be a pre-shock to the long awaited\ncorrection. But for now he believes the bull market remains\nintact. However, it could take several weeks for the market to\ncomplete a \"distribution process\" and along the way there will\nbe rallies.\n    Comer thinks it is premature to conclude that today's\naction signaled formation of a market top. He thinks the market\ncan hold in the low to mid 2200 area on the Dow index.\n    \"This probably is the correction that has been expected,\"\nsaid Crandall Hays of Robert W.
