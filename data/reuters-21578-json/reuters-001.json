In 1986, about 183 billion dlrs of\nnew eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled by\nEuromoney magazine.\n    Up until now, there have been no restrictions on lead\nmanaging eurobond issues.\n    However, eurobond market participants believe the Bank of\nEngland is concerned about intense competition for market share\nwhich may have caused some firms to expose themselves to\nimprudent credit risk.\n    Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as\nbanks compete to offer the best terms. But the new rules\nsuggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as\nregulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk\nthan it can handle. Banking sources said that while the Bank of\nEngland is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing to\naccept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters\nact prudently.\n    \"The Bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank's\nlead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill\nand experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market\nconcerned...,\" the Bank's proposal said.\n    Once a firm has received permission to act as lead\nunderwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of the\nface amount of the securities. Nominal exposure exceeding 60\npct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and it\nmust be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct of\ncapital.\n    The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of\n28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. After\nthat, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be\nassessed at their full face value.\n    The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities,\nrevolving credits or commercial paper, the Bank said.\n    The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen\nits supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which called\nfor comments from professionals by March 31 to allow their\npossible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its planned\nfinal discussion in Parliament, scheduled before summer.\n    The new Banking Bill, updating the 1979 Banking Act, is the\nthird leg of the Conservative government's legislation for the\nsupervision of financial institutions.\n    It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act,\naimed to bolster investor protection, and the Building\nSocieties Act, which put these institutions on an equal footing\nwith banks.\n    The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between\nrecognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legal\ncontrols, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors.\n    Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England in\nadvance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of their\ncapital, and to have the Bank supervise exposures between 10\nand 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed.\n    However, preliminary consultations with bank\nrepresentatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be\nflawed, it said.\n    Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a\ncase-by-case basis rather than along general lines.\n    Amendments involved the Bank's proposed treatment of\nexposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other\nunits of their own group of companies, the paper showed.\n    They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to\nlocal governments and other public sector entities, and of\nexposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks.\n    Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as\ncollateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed.\n    Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their\nown group of companies would usually be looked into on a\ncase-by-case basis under new proposals, it said.\n    The paper said exposures to state-owned industries and\nother public sector authorities in the U.K. and abroad should\nbe given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments\nprovided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees.\n    It cautioned that exposures to U.K. local authorities and\nthose guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee\nDepartment would probably not qualify for such treatment.\n    On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of\nanother bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceiling\ncould be exceeded in individual cases.\n    But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking\nto take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and state\nin writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary's\nbalance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said.\n    On collateral security, it said this \"should normally only\nbe taken into account when considering the acceptability of a\nbank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base.\"\n    \"The presence of security taken on its own will be\nconsidered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure\nin excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptional\ncircumstances and even then to a very limited extent,\" it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 3-MAR-1987 15:37:19.65","places":["uk"]},"1276":{"title":"AMERICAN AIRCRAFT BUYS INTO HELICOPTER BUILDER","body":"<American Aircraft Corp> said it\nhas acquired a 51 pct interest in privately-owned <Hunter\nHelicopter of Nevada Inc> for an undisclosed amount of stock.\n    An American Aircraft official said the company has an\noption to acquire the remaining 49 pct.\n    Hunter Helicopter is in the business of building a two\npassenger helicopter retailing for about 50,000 dlrs each which\nis certified by the Federal Aviation Administration.

Hutton said.\n    The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will\nbe the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of\nthe winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.\n    \"Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of\nus,\" an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.\n    The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares\nof winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.\nThis would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop\nand would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the\nUSDA analyst said.\n    With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able\nto reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts\nnoted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops\n-- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.\n    Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover\ncombined with cold temperatures. This winter, however,\nsnowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent,\nso the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been\ndue to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.\n    \"Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation\nbetween mediocre crops and fall dryness,\" Martell said.\n    Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal\nin southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the\nentire winter crop area, she said.\n    Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the\nsnowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused \nproblems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior\nforecaster for Accu Weather, said.\n    Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the\nfall and winter, analysts said.

This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents\na lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in\nFebruary last year following a sharp rise in international\nprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.\n    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,\nPresident Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said\nthey need to make hard commercial decisions. \"If we have failed\nat the ICO, at least we have tried,\" Dauster said, adding \"now it\nis time to go and sell coffee.\"\n    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans\nto make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next\nmonth, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade\nsources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a\nprevious crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public\nselling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market\nlast year.\n    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the\nmarket \"in one go\" but is sold over a minimum of six months.\n    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split\nbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for\nfuture quotas. Consumers said \"objective criteria\" like average\nexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,\nDauster said.\n    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but\nconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" way\nof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst\nproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.\n    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and\nnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and\nthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set\nratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.\n    It is a \"simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\"\npolicy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome\nto participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very\ndifficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve\ndifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.\n    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO\nand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.\n    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to\naccept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves\nimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.\n    \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to\nencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if\nsupplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said.\n    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer\nargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO\nsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse\nand how much producers will sink their differences should\nprices fall further and remain depressed.\n    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but\nboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real\nnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in\nIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.\n    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and\npolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could\nbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than\nmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during\nthe summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before\nOctober are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has\ncontinued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.\n    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt\nby importers and exporters was that consumers would have been\nhappy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could\nnot be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could\nshow a direct relationship between quotas and availability.\n    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the\nseemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to\nlapse should lasting agreement not be found.\n    \"Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their\nfailure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient\nand we wanted a cast iron commitment now,\" one consumer said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 3-MAR-1987 16:05:22.24","topics":["coffee"],"organisations":["ico-coffee"],"places":["uk","brazil"]},"1313":{"title":"SEAMAN FURNITURE <SEAM> IN STOCK SPLIT","body":"Seaman Furniture Co Inc said\nits board declared a two-for-one split of the company's\noutstanding stock.\n    It said holders of its common will receive one additional\nshare for each share held as of March 20.

Europe\nis inevitably a small volume market.\"\n    Hayes said the cost of changing American cars to conform to\nEuropean environmental specifications cut into profit margins.\n    But Robert Lutz, Chrysler executive vice-president, said\nthe weak dollar would now help Chrysler compete in Europe. \n\"After a lapse of almost nine years, Chrysler is about to\nre-enter the European market,\" he said.\n    \"We prefer to export to Europe rather than manufacture here\nbecause it will allow us to take full competitive advantage of\nthe favorable exchange rates due to the declining value of the\ndollar.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 4-MAR-1987 11:25:14.11","places":["switzerland","usa","uk","west-germany","spain"]},"1540":{"title":"BUNDESBANK CHANGES REPURCHASE PACT SYSTEM","body":"The Bundesbank is planning changes in\nthe system by which banks bid for funds in securities\nrepurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open\nmarket instrument, central bank officials said.\n    Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender\nprocess to two days from three currently, enabling the\nBundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it\nchooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly.\n    The changes will probably come into force in April.\n    Under the current system, banks must themselves specify at\nthe tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbank\nfor subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business.\n    Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody\naccounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks,\nwhich are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level.\n    Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in such\naccounts at the Hesse LZB, which covers the Frankfurt area.\n    The change to come into force next month will allow the\nBundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself,\nin a process legally comparable to direct debiting.\n    At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender on\nMonday, holds the tender late on Tuesday morning, announces the\nresult early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday.\n    The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28\ndays.

Analysts\nagreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they \ndiffered sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.\n    \"I'm very positive on GM,\" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder\nPeabody and Co. \"They're clearly committed to enhancing\nshareholder value.\"\n    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the\nbuyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to\nrecapture lost market share.\n    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy\nback 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The\nannouncement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,\nwith more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.\n    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the\nstock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at\nleast one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a\ngood performance expected from new car models.\n    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the\nrepurchase program is not a positive.\n    \"The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and\nputs more stress on the balance sheet,\" he said, since GM will\nhave to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock\nshould settle back down to around 76, he added.\n    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and\n5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.\nHealy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,\nwhich range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four\ndlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.\n    Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic\ncar and truck market falling in 1987. \"On balance, GM cars are\nnot selling as well as their competitors,\" he said.\n    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the\nyear-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co <F> and\nChrysler Corp <C> both posted increases. But GM said February\nsales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects\nimprovement in coming months.\n    Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall\nto around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,\nanalysts said. The numbers include imports.\n    Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product\nimprovements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the\nfourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.\n    \"GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up\nits sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major\nearnings surprise in the winds,\" he said.\n    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in\npart in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning\n5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. \"The company is more\nconcerned than ever about improving their relative valuation\nwith respect to Ford and Chrysler,\" he said.\n    Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently\nfive dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than\nits competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash\ndividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.\n    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc\nsaid U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if\nsuccessful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its\nmarket share.\n    \"I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will\nonly curtail losses in market share,\" which will fall to around\n35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.\n    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle\nof the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he\nsaid results will not improve until 1988.\n    \"I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a\ntransition year for GM,\" he said.\n    Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988\nat 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not\naffect 1987 results. \"But the key thing isn't so much what they\nearn this year.

But close ties between\ncorporate performance and wages mean that the alternative\neconomic model promises little but slower growth, they said.\n    Falling profits may lead to falling incomes, which in turn\nwill cut sales and further reduce profits.\n    The Bank of Japan said in its latest outlook that improved\nterms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domestic\ndemand grow steadily.\n    However, this would happen only if household spending\nincreased in line with the value of real financial assets due\nto stable prices, and/or if corporate investment recovered as\nprofits from domestic sales improved compared with those from\nexports.\n    \"No clear sign of such developments has so far been\nevidenced,\" the central bank said.\n    Poor business prospects are the reason why economic growth\nwill be slow, even though Japan's terms of trade have improved\nsharply due to the strong yen. Economist David Pike of Phillips\nand Drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pct\nwhile output prices fell only eight pct, giving a large price\nmargin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companies\ndid not pass that advantage on to the consumer.\n    Last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between the\nfall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop in\nconsumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms of\ntrade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors.\n    The economists, however, believe this layer of fat will\nprotect companies for only a short while. As more firms seek\nmore profits at home instead of abroad, already fierce domestic\ncompetition will increase, fueled by lower-priced imports.\nRetail prices will fall. Profit margins will suffer.\n    A December survey by top business organisation Keidanren\nconfirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves.\n    Of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector, almost\n80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in production\nvolume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance,\nsaid Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara.\n    Main counter-measures cited by the firms include cutting\nunprofitable operations, reducing work to sub-contractors\n(which employ significant numbers of workers), holding down\nwages, and reducing bonuses. The government has said it fears\nunemployment could soon double from three pct now.\n    Unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurt\nsales. But reduced bonuses, and worries about individual\nfinancial security could be even more damaging.\n    Twice a year, bonuses provide wage earners with what\namounts to an enforced lump sum in savings, encouraging them to\nbuy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza.\n    To save funds, some big firms have begun a form of tied\nbonus, forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods.\n    Economists also predict Japanese will not save less than\nthe average 16 pct of salary they do now. On the contrary, a\npoor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen the\nresolve to put money aside for old age and illness, education,\nand housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary.\n    The last government survey of public opinion said over 80\npct of citizens will continue to economise. Japan has a rapidly\nageing population and minimal social security and its workers\nfear poverty in their old age.\n    Faced with such a vicious circle, the government's\nreflationary strategies are severely limited.\n    The commitment by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and\nFinance Ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in small\nsupplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentive\nwithout reducing revenue. Independent economists have been less\nthan excited at the results.\n    Provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited.\n    The 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is politically\nimpossible to cut it further, with the basic bank savings rate\nat only 0.25 pct, Bank of Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said.\n    Almost 60 pct of Japanese still hold their savings in some\nkind of deposit, official figures show.\n    Moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive while\nfirms are planning cuts in capital investment.\n    The central bank is well aware that soaring stock and land\nprices are the only current results of high liquidity.\n    Fear of inflation also limits policy options. Political\nanalysts ascribe Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1986 big\nelection victory largely to a long period of almost zero price\ninflation. And he found this year that attempts to impose a\nsales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 4-MAR-1987 14:02:16.96","places":["japan"]},"1686":{"title":"IRANIAN OIL MINISTER DUE IN ALGERIA ON FRIDAY","body":"Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh\nis expected here on Friday for talks with his Algerian\ncounterpart Belkacem Nabi, the official Algerian news agency\nAPS said today.\n    Aqazadeh, who will be accompanied by a large delegation,\nwill have talks on bilateral relations in the field of energy\nand exchange views with Algerian officials on the current world\nenergy situation, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 4-MAR-1987 14:04:12.35","topics":["crude"],"places":["iran","algeria"]},"1687":{"title":"NORTHERN TELECOM <NT> IN PHONE PACT WITH CHINA","body":"Northern Telecom Ltd said it signed a\ncontract with the Peking Telecommunications Administration and\nthe Peking Foreign Trade Corp to supply an SL-1 automatic call\ndistributor system for Peking's central telephone office.\n    Financial terms were undisclosed.\n    It said Peking's telephone company would use the system to\nreceive and distribute incoming information requests more\neffectively among operators.\n    The company said it and Peking's telephone administration\nwere discussing cooperation on other telecommunications\nsystems.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 4-MAR-1987 14:04:49.19","places":["canada","china"]},"1688":{"title":"<GOLDOME FSB> YEAR NET","body":"Net 52.9 mln vs 21.9 mln\n    NOTE: Company is mutual savings bank.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 4-MAR-1987 14:04:59.48","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"1689":{"title":"BEAR AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE <BEAR> 4TH QTR OPER NET","body":"Oper shr 18 cts vs 28 cts\n    Oper net 1,076,000 vs 1,441,000\n    Sales 22.6 mln vs 21.2 mln\n    Avg shrs 5,970,000 vs 5,080,000\n    Year\n    Oper shr 55 cts vs 49 cts\n    Oper net 3,007,000 vs 2,521,000\n    Sales 82.9 mln vs 73.7 mln\n    Avg shrs 5,429,000 vs 4,484,000\n    Note: Full company name is Bear Automotive Service\nEquipment Co\n    Oper shr excludes extraordinary profit from utilization of\ntax loss carryforward of 231,000 dlrs, or four cts a share and\n1.2 mln dlrs, or 22 cts a share, respectively, in 1986 qtr and\nyear, and of 441,000 dlrs, or nine cts a share and 1.1 mln\ndlrs, or 23 cts a share, respectively, in 1985 qtr and year.\n    1985 year oper net excludes loss from cumulative effect of\nchange in accounting principle of 67,000 dlrs, or one ct a\nshare.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 4-MAR-1987 14:06:25.37","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"1690":{"title":"ENVIRONMENTAL POWER <POWR> UNIT GETS CONTRACT","body":"Environmental Power Corp said its\nsubsidiary, Environmental Protection Resources Inc, of Houston,\nhas been hired to build a 20 mln dlr resource recovery plant\nfor Lubbock, Texas.\n    Environmental said its subsidiary also will own and operate\nthe plant, which will convert solid waste into electricity.\n    The plant is scheduled for operation by early 1989, the\ncompany said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 4-MAR-1987 14:06:38.52","places":["usa"]},"1691":{"title":"SOFTECH <SOFT> GETS AIR FORCE CONTRACT","body":"Softech Inc said it was awarded a\n1,035,767 mln dlr contract by the U.S. Air Force Aeronautical\nSystems Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force base.\n    Under the seven-month contract, which carries four one-year\nrenewal options, Softech said it will continue to operate the\nDefense Department's Ada Validation Facility and JOVIAL\nLanguage Control Facility.\n    Total value of the contract, if renewal options are\nexercised, is 6,526,253 dlrs, the company said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 4-MAR-1987 14:06:45.65","places":["usa"]},"1692":{"title":"U.K. OIL INDUSTRY SAID NOT PERMANENTLY DAMAGED","body":"The U.K. Offshore oil industry has\nsuffered from last year's collapse in oil prices but should not\nsustain any permament damage, Minister of State for Energy\nAlick Buchanan-Smith said.\n    The drilling, diving and supply vessels sectors had been\nmost affected, Buchanan Snith told the House of Commons energy\ncommittee.

He said\nmany investors plan to sell their bonds if Japanese or U.S.\nInterest rates decline further.\n    To encourage further international use of the yen, the\nministry is considering allowing the issue of Euroyen\ncommercial paper, the official said, adding that it is studying\ndemand from potential borrowers.\n    Securities company sources believe the ministry will permit\nnon-residents to issue Euroyen commercial paper within the next\nfew months. But they expect it to continue to ban domestic\nparticipation in the market for some time to come. Japanese\nbanks object to the short-term paper market which they see\nencroaching on their business territory.\n    Traders said Euroyen commercial paper could spur more\ndemand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shift\ninto shorter-term securities if need be.\n    \"Commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps,\" one bond\nmanager said. If more financial instruments were available,\nthere might be more trades in yen, he added.\n    Euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity, though\nsome recent issues which are callable in three years work as if\nthey had shorter maturities, traders said.\n    The ministry is expected to allow four-year Euroyen bond\nmaturities within a few months.\n    One yen bond manager said Japanese financial authorities\nare giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rules\ngoverning international transactions of the yen. But freer use\nof the yen could encourage more trade settlements in the\nJapanese currency, he said. \"If exporters or importers can raise\nfunds in yen, they will be more willing to agree to using the\nJapanese yen as a settlement currency,\" he added.\n    The Finance Ministry official said the government must\nconstantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit of\nborrowers and investors. \"No major market can keep its status\nwithout change,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 01:54:56.80","places":["japan","usa"]},"1912":{"title":"SOUTH KOREAN MONEY SUPPLY RISES IN FEBRUARY","body":"South Korea's M-2 money supply rose 0.39\npct to 33,992.0 billion won in February from 33,858.4 billion\nin January, when it fell a revised 0.04 pct from December,\nprovisional Bank of Korea figures show.\n    The February figure was up 18.89 pct from a year earlier.\n    M-1 money supply rose 4.13 pct to 8,492.1 billion won in\nFebruary from January, when it fell 7.82 pct from December.

The agreement\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\n    \"You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,\nand that was well before Plaza,\" he said.\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\n    \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\nlaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\n    \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\nedge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want\nmy objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our\ntrade imbalance.

Some of them are \"too sophisticated to\nconvert into financial terms,\" one banking source said.\n    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is\nimpossible to calculate.\n    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's\neconomy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.\n    \"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-\nachieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only\ncontributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said.\n    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured\nNation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation\nfor suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under\nmartial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was\noriginally devised several years ago by the Institute of\nNational Economy, an offshoot of the central planning\ncommission.\n    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish\neconomic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth\ntrends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in\ncredits from Western commercial and government lenders.\n    But the calculations were based on a time when trade was\nbooming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing\nthe estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point,\nwhich has no real scientific evaluation.\"\n    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to\nthe U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs\nannually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were\nimposed.\n    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to\n200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade\nsurplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs\nagainst a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.\n    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important\nU.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,\nchemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits\ndried up for economic not political reasons.  \"Poland is\naccusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for\npolitical reasons,\" said one expert. \"It's an illusion based on a\nmisunderstanding of Western economy.\"\n    \"There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone\nwho has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding that\nPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits\nin the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.\n    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" one\ndiplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders\nand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of\nscientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the\nlifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact\non Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs\nand lacks the means to modernise its industry.\n    \"MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not\nbe treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to\nregain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are\nin play now,\" said one Western envoy.\n    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their\nquality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist\nmeasures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper\nPoland's efforts to regain entry.\n    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised\nthis fact recently.\n    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, \"Making\nup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly\ndifficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of\ntwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level of\nexports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\"\n    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it\nhas a \"moral right\" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says\nimposed the sanctions illegally.
