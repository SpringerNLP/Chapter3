Lawrence Inc, referring to both\nBrazil and Citicorp. Brazil recently stopped paying interest on\nits commercial bank debt. Today, CitiCorp said its first\nquarter income would be reduced by 50 mln dlrs after tax if it\nlists the loans as non-performing status.\n    Citicorp filed an 8-K form with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, indicating a material change in its financial\nsituation. \"Citicorp is saying you can't scare us with threats,\nwe'll make your loans non-performing right now,\" Berger said.\n    The loans have to be treated as non-performing after 90\ndays without a payment. CitiCorp said only that the situation\nwill be reviewed at the end of the current quarter.\n    Berger asserted that Brazil is doing its own politicking by\ntalking to U.S. regulators and trying to drive a wedge between\nU.S. and European banks.\n    Analyst Lawrence Cohn of Merrill Lynch and Co said it is\nunlikely the situation will be resolved until the second half\nof this year.\n    \"Ultimately the Brazilians are going to have to pay up on\nall the interest they owe,\" Cohn said. \"The real issue is the\nrescheduling of debt terms.\n    Another question is whether or not the International\nMonetary Fund can help Brazil with a new austerity program.\n    Stocks of money center banks were mostly down fractions in\nlate dealings. One trader most stocks in the group bounced off\ntheir lows by midday as investors took the news in stride.\n    Cohn said the bank stocks may be risky until numbers on\nnon-performing loans are reported for each bank. But he said\ninvestors looking ahead six to 12 months might want to buy at\npresent levels for the \"tremendous fundamental values\" in the\ngroup.\n    Analyst Robert Gordon of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said\nManufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC) has the greatest exposure to\nBrazilian loans of any New York bank, in terms of percentage of\nearnings. He said his only two recommendations currently among\nNew York banks are J.P. Morgan and Co <JPM> and Bankers Trust\nCo <BT> which happen to have the least exposure.\n    Gordon said his positive opinion on J.P. Morgan and Bankers\nTrust was not merely a response to the fact that the two have\nlower exposure to Brazilian loans than other banks. \n    In fact he said there's a chance those banks could get more\ninvolved in the future. He noted that Morgan has already set up\na brokerage subsidiary to deal in loans to less developed\ncountries.\n    \"I don't see any reason to change full year earnings\nestimates, said Frederick Meinke, analyst at E.F. Hutton Co. He\nthinks the confrontation with Brazil could end in a replay of a\nsituation that occurred with Argentina in 1984 and 1985.\n    Meinke noted that in the case of Argentina the loans became\nnon-accruing for a couple of quarters but then when the banks\ncame to an agreement with Argentina all the back interest was\npaid. \"What it did was distort the quarterly earnings pattern,\"\nhe said.\n    He said in the case of Brazil write-offs of loans is a\nworst-case outcome which is highly unlikely. He noted that\nBrazil is a country with a diversified economy, going through\nsome economic upheaval after the transition from a military to\na civilian government.\n    \"The countries of Latin America have too much debt relative\nto their ability to service it,\" said John Mason of\nInterstate Securities. \"We've been fiddling around with these\nproblems for five years and the hour is growing late.\"\n    He said up to now the banks have reduced their spreads, cut\ninterest rates internally and extended maturities and none of\nthese measures has been enough. He expects re-classification of\nas much as a third of the loans as non-accruing and he sees\npartial write downs of some loans.\n    Nevertheless Mason thinks the money center bank stocks \ncould be poised for a short term rally.\n    A spokesman at First Chicago Corp <FNB> said it is\npremature to put Brazil's loans on a cash basis. \"It is our\nexpectation that economic development will allow Brazil to meet\nits debt,\" a spokesman said.\n    Bankers Trust in New York said it would be premature to\nmake a decision. Several other banks queried by Reuters said\nmuch the same thing.\n    A spokesman at Manufacturers Hanover noted that of 2.3\nbillion dlrs in loan exposure to Brazil only 1.3 billion is\nsubject to Brazil's unilateral moratorium on repayment of\ninterest.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"13-MAR-1987 15:13:01.16","places":["usa","brazil"]},"5005":{"title":"ROCKWELL <ROK> TO REPURCHASE MORE COMMON SHARES","body":"Rockwell International Corp said its\nboard has authorized extension of the company's 500 mln dlr\nstock repurchase program by an additional 500 mln dlrs.\n    Since the beginning of the present repurchase program in\nMarch 1986, Rockwell said, it has bought 10.4 mln shares for\n461 mln dlrs.

But\noperators got their fingers burned as one by one the central\nbanks signalled their displeasure.\n    \"So far G-6 has been a roaring success,\"said James O'Neill,\nfinancial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA.\n    \"The central banks are sending strong signals that they\nwon't tolerate any kind of momentum building behind\ncurrencies,\" added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank.\n    On February 22, the finance ministers and central bank\ngovernors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K.\n-- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord under\nwhich they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of\nexchange rates around prevailing levels.\n    The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an\nattempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable\ntwo-year decline against major world currencies.\n    And initially, traders indicated their respect for the\naccord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower.\n    But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87\nmarks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before\nthe G-6 accord.\n    The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economy\npicked up steam in February at the same time as the West German\neconomy was regressing.\n    But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave\ntraders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the\nidea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines.\n    Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bank\nactually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simply\ntelephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading\nconditions.\n    But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around\n1.85 marks. \"The market was surprised that the Fed showed its\nface so soon,\" said Marine Midland NA's O'Neill.\n    Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of England\nintervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K.\ncurrency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before the\nG-6 pact.\n    Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies like\nthe Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor after\ntraders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant\nto the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays\non dollar/mark and dollar/yen.\n    The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving\nU.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March\n17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the\nincumbent Conservative party in any general election.\n    \"There was a real run on sterling,\" said Anne Mills of\nShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.\n    Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870\ndlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterday\nand from a peak of about 2.98 recently. \"There's been some\nheavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday's\nU.K. budget,\" said James McGroarty of Discount Corp.\n    As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. and\nBritish central banks, they acclerated their shift into\nCanadian and Australian dollars. But here too they were\nstymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency's rise.\n    The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollar\ntoday, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday.\n    And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent,\nsold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said.\n    The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. cents\ntoday from a high of 69.02 Thursday.\n    Analysts said the central banks' moves to stifle sudden\nupward movement, leave the market uncertain about its next\nstep. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a\nvery tight range against the dollar for several months.\n    The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night.\nAnalysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long\nsterling/short mark positions established lately.\n    \"Because of the change in perceptions about the health of\nthe German economy, the funds from those unwinding operations\nare ending up in yen,\" a dealer at one U.K. bank said.\n    Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders,\nlower industrial output and slowing employment gains.\n    Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who\nhave invested heavily overseas, for example in Australian\nfinancial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of the\nend of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31.\n    Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the most\ncontroversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit with\nJapan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test of\nthe dollar's downward scope against the Japanese currency.\n    In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through\nthe end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that it\nintervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28.\nOn that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen.\n    \"Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in\nJanuary.

DEBT-EQUITY SWAPS","body":"Mexico has temporarily suspended its\ndebt-equity swap program in a move that some bankers see as an\nattempt to increase pressure on reluctant foreign banks to\nparticipate in a new 7.7 billion dlr loan for the country.\n    The scheme, which gives foreign firms access to cheap pesos\nto finance investment in Mexico, is likely to resume soon after\nthe loan package is signed on March 20.\n    But the move is a further indication of the strains that\nhave developed between Mexico and the banks because of the\ndifficulty of syndicating the huge loan, bankers said.\n    Bankers said that Mexico suspended the swap program on\nFebruary 25.\n    Adolfo Hegewisch, Mexico's Undersecretary for Commerce,\nconfirmed that the swap program had been halted, but he told a\nEuromoney conference on debt-equity swaps that Mexico had been\nforced to act because it had been inundated with applications.\n    Between January 1 and February 15, 132 firms had applied to\ndo a debt-equity conversion, compared with 100 between May and\nDecember 1986. \"We were not accustomed to receive so much\nwork,\" said Hegewisch, who is responsible for foreign\ninvestment in Mexico.\n    Bankers said applications totalling two billion dlrs had\npiled up at the finance ministry, which has said it wants to\nlimit the amount of swaps to 100 mln dlrs a month.\n    But some bankers, who declined to be identified, said the\nhalt also suited Mexico as it would keep up pressure on the\nbanks during the final campaign to persuade all 400 creditors\nworldwide to participate in the loan.\n    Over 97 pct of the loan has been subscribed, but dozens of\nsmaller banks are still baulking. Assistant U.S. Treasury\nSecretary David Mulford said yesterday that the reluctance of\nthese banks had nearly jeopardized the deal at one stage.\n    \"The Mexicans basically said, We're not going to subsidize\nforeigners until we have a deal,\" one banker said.\n    Other bankers, however, said Mexico's motives were not so\nsinister and that the suspension was mainly due to the absence\nof top ministry officials in New York for the debt talks.\n    \"They want to focus on the deal, and they wanted the banks\nto focus on the deal,\" one source said.\n    Apart from the present disruption, bankers and company\nofficials said the Mexican debt-equity scheme has been a huge\nsuccess.    \n    Frank Fountain, Assistant Treasurer at Chrysler Corp, said\na 100 mln dlr swap it made in December had gone so smoothly\nthat Chrysler has plans for more.\n    Chrysler, working through Manufacturters Hanover Trust Co,\nbought Mexican public-sector debt with a face value of 110 mln\ndlrs, mainly from European banks. The cost was about 65 mln\ndlrs in cash and paper.\n    It then presented the paper to Mexico's central bank and\nreceived the equivalent of 100 mln dlrs worth of pesos which it\ninvested in its local subsidiary to produce cars for export to\nNorth America.\n    Susan Segal, senior vice president of Manufacturers\nHanover, said the swaps not only reduce Mexico's debt burden\nbut help to recapitalize local industries that may have been\nsqueezed out of the local capital markets.\n    Fountain said that even a large well-established firm such\nas Chrysler had found it difficult to arrange long-term peso\nfinancing on reasonable terms in Mexico.\n    Industrial companies have done most of the swaps to date,\nand Hegewisch said that many of the applications now pending\nare for investments in the electronic and chemical industries,\nwith Japanese and Korean firms showing particular interest.\n    But the interest is spreading. Segal said Manufacturers\nHanover has been authorized to convert part of its own\nportfolio of loans into equity investment in Mexican hotels.\n    She said the sums involved are considerable, but gave no\ndetails.

concern about the foreign impact of a proposed\nEuropean Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats are\nexpected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here\ntomorrow.\n    EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the\nEC Executive Commission's proposal to impose a hefty tax on\ndomestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a\nproposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations.\n    The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform\npackage, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this\nmonth, of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as\nthe root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and of\ntensions with major trading partners.\n    The proposal is described by its promoters as a\nstabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going\ninto massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut\ncereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward\ntax.\n    They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats\nproduction and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by\na fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two\nbillion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm\ncosts.\n    It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as\nwell as foreign exporters, led by the United States.\n    The diplomats said the protests had been received from most\ncorners of the developing and developed world, ranging from\nSenegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada,\nIceland and Norway.\n    The proposal had little chance of approval by EC\ngovernments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as\nBritain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also\nunconvinced of its political or economic wisdom.\n    Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and\nGreece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not\nseem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to\nthe list of products affected.\n    But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S.\nAnd elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote\nanti-EC action, and the foreign ministers' debate should\ndemonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within\nthe EC and deprive its oponents of this argument.\n    The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the\nU.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a\nbill that would curb EC textile exports.\n    The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly\nback a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill, if\nenacted, would provoke swift EC retaliation.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"15-MAR-1987

in the case, currency sources said.\n    They were commenting after weekend newspaper reports that\nprosecutors were transferring the focus of their enquiries to\nFrankfurt, West Germany's main foreign exchange centre.\n    Volkswagen announced last Tuesday that it had called in\nprosecutors to investigate a possible fraud involving currency\nhedging.\n    The newspaper Welt am Sonntag said the investigation by\nstate prosecutors was now considering whether the alleged VW\ncurrency manipulators had outside banking accomplices.\n    The transactions were only possible, \"because the culprits\npossessed genuine bank forms, with the help of which they were\nable to deceive controllers for years,\" the newspaper said.\n    But currency sources said there were so many loopholes in\nevery bank's currency dealing system that controls could easily\nbe avoided.\n    Rolf Selowsky, financial member of the management board,\nhas resigned in the wake of the affair, a VW spokesman said.\n    Selowksy's resignation followed a VW announcement on Friday\nthat foreign exchange chief Burkhard Junger had been dismissed\nand Guenther Borchert, head of the financial

no charges have been laid.\n    VW Supervisory board chairman Karl Gustaf Ratjen said\nentire data tapes had been erased and programs altered in\nforged transactions.\n    Der Spiegel magazine said VW financial controllers\ndiscovered the uncovered positions on February 18 when VW\nexpected a currency forward contract with the Hungarian\nNational Bank to mature, but Hungarian bank officials said they\nknew nothing of the transaction and the supposed contracts were\nforgeries.\n    The Budapest-based bank refused to buy the dollars and has\nnot commented on the affair.\n    The Hungarian National Bank is, along with the Soviet Bank\nof Foreign Trade, one of two major East Bloc currency traders\nand most major banks based in Germany deal with it regularly.\n    It would not be possible, the sources said, for any bank to\nrenege on a genuine forward contract since this would\nimmediately become known and effectively prevent the bank from\noperating further in the spot or forward currency markets.\n    Longer-maturity forward contracts, even contracts of up to\n10 years, were now becoming more common, they said but the\nlonger and larger the contract, the more likely it was that it\nwould be transacted with a domestic institution.\n    Being one of Germany's most diversified multi-nationals, VW\nhas exposure in a large number of currencies and dealt in these\nwith most banks in Frankfurt and also abroad, sometimes through\ncurrency brokers, although it has the reputation of doing\nrelatively little hedging, currency sources said.\n    \"They (VW) are always in

contracts\nbeginning at the end of 1984, when the dollar was rising.\n    But the currency sources said market speculation was that\ndollar income of around one billion dlrs was involved and that\nthe bulk of the transactions occurred last year since which\ntime around 50 pfennigs per dollar was lost when the dollar\nfall continued.\n    Longer-maturity currency contracts for more than 100 or

Juergen Becker, director of the Bundesbank's division of\nbanking law and credit supervision, said the U.S.-British\nproposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate.\n    But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to\nproduce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals.\n    \"There is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latter\nstages,\" one representative of the German Banking Association in\nCologne said. Bankers expect rule changes this year.\n    All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank, West\nGermany's four major banking associations and the Federal\nBanking Supervisory Office.\n    Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes\nwould require a revision of Germany's credit law, which has\nbeen in effect since 1934.\n    Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit\npresent circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary\npolitical process of changing it, banking sources said.\n    Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited\nbanks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves,\non a consolidated basis.\n    But lending ratios do not extend to several newer\ninstruments such as spot and forward currency contracts,\ncurrency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs,\ncurrency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies\nand various innovative types of interest rate hedges.\n    The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals\nlay in differentiating between different types of risk factor,\nand, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps\nthan interest swaps. But even if German banking authorities\nagree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on\nhow to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk.\n    U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of\nformulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in\nswaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial\nintermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous.\nThis is the so-called market-to-market value.\n    But German authorities are likely to consider this much too\ncomplex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of\nlending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of\nthe borrowers involved, the sources said.\n    The weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended\nto include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for public\nauthorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign\nbanks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers.\n    A further complication is that the more flexible\ndefinitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put\nGerman banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said.\n    Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of\nthe U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S.\nAnd British authorities, the sources said.\n    One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated\nforeign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be\nbrought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite\nthe fact that the risk may be entirely different.\n    How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was\nuncertain. Many have converted to full subsidiary status and\napplied for a full banking licence over the last two years in\norder to lead-manage mark eurobonds.\n    But as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lending\nratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement,\nparticularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if they\nare required to include more transactions in the balance sheet,\nthe sources added.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"16-MAR-1987 03:00:35.30","topics":["money-fx"],"places":["west-germany","usa","uk"]},"5202":{"title":"NEW ZEALAND GOVERNMENT BORROWS 100 MLN STERLING","body":"The New Zealand government borrowed\n100 mln stg on the Eurosterling market to refinance a loan of\nthe same amount maturing in June, Finance Minister Roger\nDouglas said in a statement.\n    The coupon rate is 9.62 pct and the loan life is eight\nyears.\n    Douglas said the coupon rate is the lowest obtained by the\ngovernment on a sterling loan since 1971.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"16-MAR-1987 03:03:34.26","places":["new-zealand"]},"5203":{"title":"BHP TO MERGE BHP MINERALS AND UTAH INTERNATIONAL","body":"The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S>\nsaid it will merge its BHP Minerals division and <Utah\nInternational Inc> into a single business unit under a common\nmanagement structure.\n    The merger will be effective June 1, coinciding with the\nretirement of Utah International chairman and chief executive\nBud Wilson, BHP said in a statement.\n    The new BHP-Utah Minerals International Group will be\nheaded by Jim Curry as executive general manager and chief\nexecutive officer.

O. Licht.\n    Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural\nexperts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved\nseed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this.\nIn recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late\nboost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing\nstarts to growing seasons.\n    Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers\nwill grow so-called \"C\" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world\nmarket. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area\nneeded to meet the EC \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, which receive full and\npartial price support, respectively.\n    Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week\nbetween producers and the EC commission over its export policy\ncould have serious implications for future sugar output.\n    Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly\none mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as\nthey feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for\nthe gap between high EC internal and low world market prices.\n    However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point,\nthis could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting\nhigher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future\ncut in the basic \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, they added.\n    In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota\nsugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first\nplanting intentions indicate an area about the same as last\nyear's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year.\n    \"The basic trend is towards stability,\" a FIRS spokesman\nsaid. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white\nsugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not\nencouraging higher planting levels, he said.

This should\nyield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's crop\nequalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes.\n    British Sugar has \"A\" and \"B\" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes\nof whites and its \"C\" output is due to improved yields from more\nconsistent disease-resistant seed types.\n    Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty\nNowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar\nIndustry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish\nproduction costs and there is no way to convince farmers to\nincrease the area above the already signed contracted level.\n    The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put\nplantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in\n1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes.\n    World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or\nGermany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to\nthe domestic market, an official at the national beet growers'\nassociation said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but\nsurveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especially\nin the north where some farmers have switched to soya.\n    Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher\nthan expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar.\n    Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a\nrecord 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes\ninto force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest\nDutch sugar processor, said.\n    The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes\nof white sugar and to cut output of \"C\" sugar. Last year, the\nNetherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar\nagainst a combined \"A\" and \"B\" quota of only 872,000 tonnes.\n    \"The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher\nthan it has done recently to make planned production of \"C\" sugar\nreally worthwhile,\" the spokesman said.\n    Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting\nintentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year's\nSoviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year.\n    Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some\n95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but\ndiplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic\ndemand.\n    The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are\nestimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year.\n    A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De Danske\nSukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged\nfrom 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha.\n    In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic\ndemand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha\nagainst 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar\ncompany Svenska Sockerfabriks AB.\n    Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to\nlate sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987\nplantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down\nfrom 37,600 in 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"16-MAR-1987 04:39:56.06","topics":["sugar"],"organisations":["ec"],"places":["uk","france","west-germany","sweden","netherlands","hungary","spain","denmark","ireland"]},"5215":{"title":"SWISS UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS TO 0.9 PCT IN FEBRUARY","body":"Swiss unemployment edged down to 0.9 pct\nof the working population from one pct in January and in\nFebruary 1986, the Federal Office of Industry, Trade and Labour\nsaid.\n    Seasonally adjusted, however, there was a slight rise in\nunemployment.\n    The number out of work fell to 28,439, down 1,142 compared\nwith the previous month.

On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa\nfutures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has\nalso contributed to the recent slip in prices.\n    The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the\n\"must buy\" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact,\nwhich came into force at the last ICCO session in January but\nwithout rules for the operation of the buffer stock.\n    Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should\noperate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement\nlimits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it\ncannot operate on futures markets.\n    A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost\n100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or\nselling operations, were carried forward from the previous\nagreement.\n    Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on\nall cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes.\n    The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on\nbuffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be\nover non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should\npay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working\ngroup is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative\nmatters, and the full council meets on Thursday.\n    Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds\nshould not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member\ncountries such as Malaysia.\n    Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer\nstock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate\nmanufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas.\n    The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked\nto the one over differentials for different qualities.\n    European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a\ncompromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can\nrepresent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures\nmarket's existing differentials for different qualities.\n    Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto\nthe London market.\n    Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50\nstg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa.\n    Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would\noperate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the\nhighest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower.\n    The January talks were slowed by a split inside the\nEuropean Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France\nsiding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session\nin Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground\nand, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions\namong the 12 nations.\n    The source said the EC will be looking for signs of\nflexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and\nwill be able to respond if they are there.\n    One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split\nsaid consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and\nbacks the concept of the pact which is \"meant to support the\nmarket where trade buying is not.\"\n    In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their\ncocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers.\n    Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include\nwhether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced\n\"posted price\" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is\nbuying then accepting offers.\n    In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that\nproducers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of\ncocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a\nway that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"16-MAR-1987 06:42:20.68","topics":["cocoa"],"organisations":["ec","ico-coffee","itc","icco"],"places":["uk"]},"5259":{"title":"CATHAY PACIFIC WINS TORONTO ROUTE LICENSE","body":"Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HK>\nhas won a two-year license from the Hong Kong government to\noperate scheduled flights to Toronto, a Cathay spokesman said.\n    He told Reuters the airline had sought a five-year right to\nadd Toronto to its existing license to serve the United States\nand Canada.\n    \"We're pleased,\" the spokesman said. \"It's important because\nToronto has a large ethnic Chinese commmunity and there's a\ngrowing amount of travel.\"\n    Canadian and British authorities must agree on air service\nrights before Cathay can begin service to toronto.\n    Cathay Pacific is controlled by Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.\nHK>.\n    Hongkong Dragon Airlines Ltd, a fledgling locally  based\nairline, had opposed the move, saying that Cathay should wait\nuntil its license for its U.S. And Canadian routes expires in\nFebruary next year.\n    A hearing started today and continues tomorrow.

Ultra-liberalism is impossible.\"\n    Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard.\nOver the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls\nhave been largely abolished, labour regulations have been\npruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely\npopular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks\nand industries to private investors.\n    Since December, nearly five mln French investors have\nbought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.PA> and glass\nmaker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA <SGEP.PA>, the first two state\ncompanies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion\nfranc five-year privatisation plan.\n    Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of\ncapital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has\nflooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift\nthe market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since\nDecember.\n    At the end of last year the government abolished price\ncontrols that had existed for 42 years on services such as car\nrepairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small\nbusinesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.\n    The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices\nin January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the\nofficial 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or\nless.\n    \"But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you\nconsider that prices are now free for the first time since\n1945,\" commented Develle of Paribas.\n    Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's\nforeign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1\nbillion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and\ndown from 153.3 billion in 1985.\n    But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a\ngradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French\nfranc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating\nthree pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second\nsince Chirac took power.\n    A recent report by the Organisation for Economic\nCooperation and Development pilloried French industry for\nfailing to produce the goods that its potential customers\nwanted.\n    Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology\nsectors, French industrial goods were \"increasingly ill-adapted\nto demand\" and over-priced, the report said.\n    French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed\nwith the report. \"One of the assumptions of the government is\nthat if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and\nmodernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like\nfreedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,\" he said.\n    And despite rising industrial investment and the\nintroduction of special incentives to boost youth employment,\nthe end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7\nmillion, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.\n    The problem for the government is that there may be little\nmore it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.\n    French producers failed more than most to take advantage of\nlast year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the\nshaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like\nWest Germany and Japan, they say.\n REUTER...\n\u0003","date":"16-MAR-1987 09:15:43.81","topics":["cpi"],"places":["france"]},"5319":{"title":"SPECTRA <SPCT> TESTS OF NEW DRUG NOT ENCOURAGING","body":"Spectra Pharmaceutical Services\nInc said current clinical studies of its proposed dry eye drug\nTretinoin have not produced encouraging results based on\npreliminary indications.\n    The compnay said the tests are being conducted for\nsubmission to the Food and Drug Administration for the drug\nwhich has the trade name Lacramore.\n    Spectra said earlier studies showing dramatic improvements\nin isolated cases have still occurred.

You'll find a lot of people who think we have not\ndone the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven't\navoided violating agreements.\"\n    In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful\nchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade\nsubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced\nReagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports\nfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices.\n    It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would\nhurt the U.S. economy.\n    Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois\nDemocrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if\nthe House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.\n    Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a\ntough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this\nyear only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he\nsaw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill.\n    As an indication of his success, White House spokesman\nMarlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still\ndid not like some provisions. But he added, \"Generally we feel\nvery good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade\nlegislation. I think we are progressing very well.\"\n    The first battle will take place next week when the full\nHouse Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.\nRichard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such\nas Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses\nwith the United States.\n    The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only\nthat the existence of a large trade surplus with the United\nStates will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,\nbut would not automatically set off retaliation.\n    Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch free\ntrader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan.\n    Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from\nimports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.\nAFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the\nadministration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would\nsign would not be worth passage in Congress.\n    But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a\nstatement, \"I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane\nKirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed\nby the president.\"\n    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for\ntrade relief for specific industries such as textiles.\n    Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to hold\noff his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protect\nthe domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan\nvetoed a similar measure last year.\n    House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of the\nmost influential proponents of aid for specific industries\nbeset by low priced foreign competition.\n    Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the\ndomestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate\nplan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports\nreach half of domestic consumption.\n    For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S.\nenforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administration\nto act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as\ndumping products in the United States at prices below the cost\nof production.\n    It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an\nindustry complains that a surge in imports threatens its\nexistence.

But many economists say the system,\nwhich holds eight European Community currencies within narrow\nfluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.\n    Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has\nbeen a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike\nseeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.\n    And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as\nEurope's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality\nwhen Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.\n    But economists say members such as West Germany have so far\nblocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's\nfounding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and\nformer French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.\n    Under this phase, originally due to have started two years\nafter the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been\ntransferred from national governments and central banks to an\nautonomous European Monetary Fund.\n    But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in\neconomic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is\nthat governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a\nsituation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one\neconomist who has closely watched the system's development.\n    The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on\nthird currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the\nsystem's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.\n    Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and\ninvestors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp\nrise of the West German mark severely strained the system.\n    Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the\nEMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world\ncurrency, outside the system.\n    No change in the British government's attitude is expected\nbefore the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.\n    Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it\nwas set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's\nhighly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central\nBank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.\n    Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers\nhold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.\n    But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve\nmore than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical\nabout the chances for any fundamental change.\n    \"Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS\nagainst external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we\nmust take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leo\nde Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.\n    Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend\nlargely on the success of an agreement last month among major\nindustrial nations to stabilise exchange rates.

voted\nunanimously that Upjohn Co's Rogaine baldness drug was safe and\neffective.\n    The panel recommended that the FDA approve Rogaine for\nmarketing in the United States, so long as accompanying\npackaging and promotional materials disclose that the product\nhas only limited effect on male pattern baldness.\n    The five outside experts attending today's FDA committee\nmeeting seemed less concerned about Rogaine's safety after an\noutside consultant told them the drug \"appears to be quite safe\nin the normal male population.\"\n    The consultant, Ohio State University Professor of Medicine\nCarl Leier, said Rogaine's side effects were minimal, based on\na study of 10,000 individuals who have been getting the drug in\nCanada, where it was approved for marketing last year.\n    \"The Canadian record is quite a good one in terms of side\neffects,\" Leier said.\n    The experts urged the FDA to require a warning in the\ndrug's packaging that patients be monitored for heart effects\nwhile taking the drug, such as irregular heart beats, changes\nin heart rate, palpitations and fluid retention in the body.\n    Rogaine, whose chemical name is minoxidil, has already been\napproved by the FDA when taken orally as a high blood pressure\ndrug.\n    But Upjohn is now seeking agency approval of it as a male\nbaldness treatment when put directly on the skin in liquid\nform.\n    Upjohn has previously claimed that, when applied to the\nscalp, too little of Rogaine was absorbed into the bloodstream\nto affect the heart.\n    But panel members concluded that the amount absorbed\nmerited physician monitoring of patients taking the drug.\n    Under questioning by panel members, Upjohn official Richard\nDe Villez acknowledged the drug in clinical trials produced\nmoderate hair growth on the crown of the head in only about 40\npct after 12 months.\n    He also acknowledged discontinuing treatment would make the\nnew hair fall out.\n    \"The Upjohn problem is that they have a tremendous placebo\neffect,\" panel member Paul Bergstresser of the University of\nTexas told the meeting.\n    He said patients administered a placebo during clinical\ntrials typically had about half as much new hair growth as did\nindividuals treated with Rogaine.\n    As a result, it may take patients eight-12 months before\nthey can tell whether thay are benefiting from the drug, he\nsaid.\n    In Canada, a year's treatment costs about 550-640 dlrs\n(U.S.).\n    An Upjohn official said no price would be set for the drug\nin the U.S. market until it was approved for sale.\n    During trials, the drug was found to have a bizarre side\neffect on some individuals: It caused a state of sexual\ndysfunction known as \"exagerrated erection.\"\n    Stewart Ehrreich, a former FDA official who conducted a\nsafety review of Rogaine before leaving the agency, said\nresearchers had found a number of cases of patients who had\nexagerrated erections as a result of the drug.\n    He said this was a common effect for drugs of the same\nclass as Rogaine, called vaso-dilators.\n    FDA officials said they could make no prediction on when\nRogaine might be approved for marketing.\n    Following the vote, panel member Dr. Robert Stern, a Boston\ndermatologist, said Upjohn statistics had exaggerated the\neffect of the drug.\n    He said \"about one in five will have a substantial clinical\neffect,\" which he defined as a significant growth of new hair\nthat made the patient actually look better.\n    He urged insurance companies not to cover the cost of\nRogaine treatment in order to preserve scarce medical fund\nresources.\n    \"I would hope that insurance companies will take a strong\nline that this is not a product we will reimburse for,\" Stern\ntold reporters.\n    \"I think this is a drug that has some application for some\npeople, and I think some people will find it worth the expense,\"\nhe said.\n    But he said individuals should be required to pay for the\ntreatment out of their personal funds.\n    Stern estimated more than 100,000 American men are already\nusing minoxidil on their scalps, outside the law, by

It\nalso forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry\ncomplains that a surge in imports threatens its existence.\n    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for\ntrade relief for specific industries such as textiles.\n    Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too\nmany concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back\namendments to \"get tough\" with countries that violate trade\nagreements or keep out U.S. products.\n    But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade\nsaid the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes\nand they will seek to restore his negotiating powers.\n    Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was not\none \"that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,\"\nbut he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work\ntoward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse.\n    The goal of trade legislation was \"to make our trade policy\nstronger without violating our international trade agreements,\"\nhe said.\n    In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means\nCommittee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade\nsubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced\nReagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports\nfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices.\n    It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if\nit would hurt the U.S. economy.\n    Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was\nnecessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign\ninto law.\n    Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough\nHouse trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he\nonly reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw\nDemocratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation.\n    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late\nlast week that the administration still did not like some of\nthe bill's provisions, but he added, \"Generally we feel very\ngood about the bipartisan consideration of the trade\nlegislation.

Rowe Price umbrella or\namong outside money managers, Collins thinks stocks are better\ninvestments than bonds at this time.\n    \"In the near term, the stock market has more prospects for\ngrowth, due to the mixed signals on the economy so far, the\nslim chance the Federal Reserve will ease policy and still\nheavy debt accumulation,\" Collins said.\n    He expects U.S. stocks to improve further because there is\nmore corporate earnings potential, nominal interest rates\nalready are low and there is strong foreign demand for stock.\n    Collins said that in funds which include bonds and stocks,\nthe firm has long maintained an aggressive 75 pct weighting in\nequity with the rest in bonds and cash.\n    \"Our equity managers have taken a slightly heavier cash\nposition in equity portfolios lately,\" Collins said.\n    \"Cash\" in portfolios usually means short Treasury bills\nwhich can be readily sold to allow rapid investment shifts.\n    Many portfolio managers are working with relatively high\ncash positions in equity accounts, often 25 to 30 pct, given  \nthe belief that there may well be downward price corrections\nenroute to higher ground.\n    In bond portfolios, the money managers generally showed a\npreference for shorter term (10 years and under) Treasury notes\nand, to a lesser extent, agency securities, rather than\nlonger-dated Treasury issues and corporate bonds.\n    Since yield premiums of corporate over Treasury bonds are\nnow the lowest in years, many investors believe corporates are\novervalued versus Treasury and agency issues. Another negative\ncited for corporate bonds is the risk of hostile takeovers,\nleveraged buyouts and sudden ratings declines that does not\nexist with Treasury or Federal agency securities.\n    Farm Credit paper was cited by some as undervalued and a\ngood buy, despite the issuer's well-publicized financial woes.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"16-MAR-1987 15:09:23.56","places":["usa"]},"5632":{"title":"NEW PLAN REALTY TRUST <NPR> 2ND QTR NET","body":"Qtr ends Jan 31\n    Shr 22 cts vs 19 cts\n    Net 4,549,000 vs 3,666,000\n    Revs 8,903,000 vs 7,791,000\n    Avg shrs 20.9 mln vs 19.9 mln\n    Six mths\n    Shr 42 cts vs 41 cts\n    Net 8,641,000 vs 7,928,000\n    Revs 17.5 mln vs 14.6 mln\n    Avg shrs 20.8 mln vs 19.4 mln\n    NOTE: earnings were restated to reflect the three-for-two\nstock split on April one, 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"16-MAR-1987 15:12:04.08","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"5633":{"title":"BELLSOUTH <BLS> EXPANDS MOBILE PHONE SERVICE","body":"BellSouth Corp's BellSouth\nMobility Inc unit said its mobile phone customers can now\nchoose their long-distance carrier.\n    Previously, all mobile calls were routed through American\nTelephone and Telegraph Co's long distance service.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"16-MAR-1987 15:17:58.41","places":["usa"]},"5634":{"title":"SCHLUMBERGER SAYS IT TERMINATES PACT TO SELL FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR BUSINESS TO FUJITSU\n","date":"16-MAR-1987 15:24:56.83","topics":["acq"]},"5635":{"title":"MORE CCC CREDIT GUARANTEES FOR ALGERIA -- USDA","body":"The Commodity Credit Corporation\n(CCC) has approved an additional 84.0 mln dlrs in credit\nguarantees for sales of U.S. agricultural products to Algeria\nfor fiscal year 1987 under the Export Credit Guarantee Program\n(GSM-102), the U.S. Agriculture Department said.\n    The department said the additional guarantees provide up to\n31.0 mln dlrs in coverage for sales of protein meals, 9.0 mln\ndlrs for tallow, and 44.0 mln dlrs for vegetable oils.\n    The latest guarantees increase the cumulative fiscal 1987\nprogram for sales of U.S. agricultural products to Algeria to\n464.0 mln dlrs from 380.0, it said.\n    To be eligible for the credit guarantees, all sales must be\nregistered with the CCC by September 30, and shipments\ncompleted by December 31, 1987, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"16-MAR-1987 15:29:04.98","topics":["meal-feed","veg-oil"],"places":["usa","algeria"]},"5636":{"title":"PL 480 COMMODITIES FOR HONDURAS -- USDA","body":"The United States has signed a\nPublic Law 480 agreement with Honduras to provide for the sale\nof 12.0 mln dlrs worth of U.S. agricultural commodities, the\nU.S. Agriculture Department said.\n    The agreement, signed March 11, provides for the sale of\nabout 75,000 tonnes of wheat/wheat flour worth 8.5 mln dlrs,\n15,000 tonnes of corn/sorghum worth 1.5 mln dlrs and 6,000\ntonnes of tallow worth 2.0 mln dlrs, the department said.\n    The commodities will be supplied in the current fiscal\nyear, ending September 30, and sales will be by private U.S.\ntraders on a competitive bid basis.\n    Purchase authorizations will be announced as issued.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"16-MAR-1987 15:30:15.82","topics":["grain","wheat","corn","sorghum"],"places":["usa","honduras"]},"5637":{"title":"U.S. EXPORTERS REPORT 150,000 TONNES CORN  SOLD TO UNKNOWN DESTINATIONS FOR 1986/87\n","date":"16-MAR-1987 15:32:02.30","topics":["grain","corn"],"places":["usa"]},"5638":{"title":"NIGERIAN RIOTERS TO FACE SUMMARY TRIAL","body":"More than 500 people arrested during last\nweek's riots in northern Nigeria will face summary trial by a\njudicial tribunal, President Ibrahim Babangida said.\n    He said investigations showed the the violence was\ncarefully planned by \"evil men\" and those arrested would be tried\nfor arson, murder, rape and treason, some of which carry the\ndeath penalty.\n    Babangida said the crisis was \"the civilian equivalent of an\nattempted coup d'etat\" against the government.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"16-MAR-1987 15:33:40.43","places":["nigeria"]},"5639":{"title":"SENS.

But they offered no glimpse of a grand design to\nbanish the specter of a widespread repudiation of the region's\n380 billion dlr debt. \"Such a solution is still not in sight,\"\nsaid Nobel Prize-winning economist Franco Modigliani.\n    The conference was held against the background of the\nrecent suspension of interest payments by Brazil and Ecuador,\nbut it was Argentine finance secretary Mario Brodersohn who\nspelled out most clearly the social and economic strains caused\nby the need to service billions of dlrs of debt.\n    Brodersohn, who is negotiating currently with foreign banks\nfor a 2.15 billion dlr loan for 1987, says Argentina will have\nto grow at a four pct annual rate between now and 1992 simply\nto restore per capita income to the level of 1975.\n    He said the investment needed to fuel this growth can come\npartly from structural economic reforms at home, but this alone\nwill not be enough.\n    \"We have to reduce the transfer of resources,\" Brodersohn\nsaid, adding that mounting economic strains in Latin America\nmake this a matter of urgency.\n    Brodersohn and other Latin officials, however, did not\nspell out how this should be achieved.\n    The creditors' strategy, spelled out by U.S. Treasury\nSecretary James Baker in October 1985, is to spur additional\nlending by private banks and multilateral development banks in\nreturn for economic reforms.\n    But there was a widespread recognition at the conference\nthat the Baker Plan has fallen well short of expectations.\n    Miguel Urrutia, a senior official of the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank, for instance, said IADB lending had actually\ndeclined in 1986 and had started slowly in 1987.\n    Mexico is due to sign a 7.7 billion dlr loan on Friday that\nwill be the first major facility under the Baker Plan, which\ncalled for net new bank lending between 1986 and 1988, a target\nthat Morris Goldstein of the International Monetary Fund said\nis now optimistic.\n    Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American\nAffairs Paul Taylor acknowledged that the Baker Plan \"has not\nyet succeeded as well as we hoped.\"\n    But if the debtors at the conference were hoping to hear an\nofficial commitment to try a new tack, they must have been\ndisappoiunted.\n    Ted Truman, director of the International Finance Diviision\nat the Federal Reserve Board, said banks were short-sighted in\nnot lending promptly and in the amounts called for by Baker.\n    He said some streamlining of the lending process may be\nneeded, but added, \"I see no alterantive to the present course\nof responsible cooperation.\"\n    A major theme at the conference, however, was that the\nworld economy might not continue to cooperate while the debtors\nand creditors muddle along. If export markets dry up because of\nrecession or protectionism, speakers warned, Latin America will\nbe even more hard-pressed to service its debts.\n    Rimmer de Vries, chief international economist at Morgan\nGuaranty Trust Co, said he was very concerned that world\neconomic growth of three to 3-1/2 pct cannot be sustained and\nthat West Germany and Japan wowuld not take up the slack in the\nworld economy that will arise as the U.S. narrows its trade\ndeficit.\n    \"There's a deflationary force coming down the mountain, and\nI don't know who's going to be rolled over,\" de Vries said.

French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending\nthe agreement because mounting political controversy in the\nU.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake\ncould be completed in a reasonable time.\n    The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and\nDefence Department, partly on national security grounds.\n    Fujitsu's acquisition of Fairchild would have given the\nJapanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North\nAmerican sales and distribution system and access to\nmicroprocessor technology, an area where Fujitsu is weak,\nanalysts said.\n    The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional\nmicrochip production facilities worldwide, eight of them in the\nU.S., A report by the Capel firm said.\n    \"It was an entry point, a port for

in attempts to acquire U.S. High\ntech firms but they are unlikely to stop, analysts said.\n    Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly\nroute of expanding its own production and distribution\nfacilities in the U.S., Although some said it could use the\nestimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to\nacquire some less politically symbolic firm.\n    \"It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions, but the\nnecessity of expanding their production and design capacity in\nAmerica remains,\" said Capel's Murtha. \"The Japanese will\ncontinue to shop for bargains, but it will be harder to find\nones that are politically acceptable.\"\n    Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or\nsmaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash\nthat blocked the Fairchild sale, analysts said. \"They're not\ngoing to slow up, they're just going to buy smaller pieces ...\nBecause of the political risk,\" said Barclays de Zoete's May.\n    Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct\nshares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as super\nminicomputer makers, he said.\n    Opposition of the sort that blocked

presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament,\nsaid U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar\n1987.\n    He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of\npayments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1\nbillion shortfall in 1986.\n    Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this\nyear, Lawson said.\n    \"As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may\ncontinue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by\nthe summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the\nyear,\" he added.\n    Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR),\nLawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0\nbillion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP.\n    The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg.\n    On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for\nthe narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal\n1987/88.\n    No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3\naggregate, he said. \"But broad money will continue to be taken\ninto account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course\nwill the exchange rate,\" the Chancellor told Parliament.\n    Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 \"is\nchiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax\nrevenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an\nincreasingly profitable business sector in particular.\"\n    On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier\nassumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per\nbarrel in calendar 1987.\n    He said \"it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax\nrevenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the\neconomy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the\npublic finances in a very strong position.\"\n    Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at\n1.0 pct of GDP in future.\n    \"We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term\nFinancial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0\npct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years\nahead,\" Lawson said.\n    \"Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this\nyear for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course\nremains a major objective of government policy.\"\n    \"But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence\nand caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.\"\n    Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange\nControl Act from the Statute book.\n    On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged\nat 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be\ncharged at the \"appropriate corporation tax rate.\"\n    He said that under the new proposed system, companies\nshould be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments\nagainst tax on capital gains.\n    \"Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in\n1988/89,\" Lawson said.\n    Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building\nsocieties be treated the same way on payment of corporation\ntax, \"with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after\nthe end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.\"\n    \"I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new\nmethod of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and\nFile.\"\n    This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax\ncollection, and would not come into force until the early\n1990s.\n    Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax\n(PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct\nof the costs of developing certain new fields set against their\n(PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those\nnew fields exceeds the costs incurred.\n    Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending\non research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any\nparticular field.\n    On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive\ntax relief for retraining workers.\n    Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value\nAdded Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax\non the basis of cash paid and received.\n    Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of\nquarterly.
