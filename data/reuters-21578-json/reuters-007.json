Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC\n13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.\n    In coarse grains, Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pct\ncompared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.\nJapan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC\nand 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.\n    For sugar, Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the\nEC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.\n    The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial\ncountries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in most\ncases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC and\nJapan, the sources said.\n    Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developing\ncountry producers of commodities, were not included in the OECD\nwork.\n    Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to\nrelease the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECD\nministerial meeting in Paris during May.\n    Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a \nbasis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade\ntalks now underway in Geneva.\n    British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit\nto Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting\npoint for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.\n    He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate\ndown domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of\nthe present crisis in world agriculture.\n    However, the OECD study results are controversial because\nthey highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials\nfamiliar with the study said.\n    The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service\nrecently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to\nverify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.\n    In some cases the results were substantially different than\nthe OECD's, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and\nelsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base\nperiod of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.\n    For example, the USDA study found the United States\nsubsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49\npct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.\n    French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale,\nciting the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told\nreporters last week that the United States subsidizes its\nfarmers more than the EC.\n    However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably\nhigher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.\n    Officials of several countries have been asked to\ncontribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to\n1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the\ncurrent world farm situation.\n    The updated calculations, which may take several months to\ncomplete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S.\nsubsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive\nimport quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.\n    U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm\nbill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to\ngrain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials\nadded.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-MAR-1987 09:03:09.08","topics":["grain","wheat","corn"],"organisations":["oecd","ec"],"places":["usa","japan"]},"7063":{"title":"FIRST AMERICAN

Taken together, the four\nAmerican-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss\nfrancs.\n    But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and\npredicted a lively future.\n    Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG\nsaid: \"The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a\nlong-term investment in gold with limited risk.\"\n    Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on\nFebruary 27, following it up with a second issue less than a\nweek later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA.\n    The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich\norganized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque\nIndosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty\n(Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of\nNew York.\n    The four issues now offer investors striking prices for\ngold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the\nsame price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on\nthe first one for Citibank.\n    The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities\nfrom 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases\nlonger than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets.\n    The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to\nthe February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a\njump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation.\n    \"Many people are worried about inflation again,\" said Mats\nJoensson of Goldman Sachs. \"Money supply in Germany and the\nUnited States has grown very strongly in the last year and\npeople want to take a ride on gold.\"\n    The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has\nlanguished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few\nweeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more\nhighly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited.\n    Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in\nSwitzerland. \"People here understand gold, and they understand\nwarrants,\" he said.\n    Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of\nequity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares\nover the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched\ncovered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give\nforeign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed\nto all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage.\n    But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up\nwhen Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks.\n    The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple\npremiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide\nscientific comparisons between titles in the options market.\n    Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was\ncompetitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for\nfive ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making\na premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct.\n    Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's\nlong, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit\nvolatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off,\nwhich he claimed was lower than the other issues.\n    But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used\npointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and\nemphasized that the models were at best an inexact science.\n    And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit\nvolatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct.\n    Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm\nwelcome from investors.\n    Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand,\neven among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants\napiece. \"The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because\nthe premiums are too high,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"19-MAR-1987 09:34:42.05","topics":["gold"],"places":["switzerland"]},"7089":{"title":"JEFFERIES GROUP CHAIRMAN RESIGNS, PLEADS GUILTY TO SECURITIES VIOLATIONS\n","date":"19-MAR-1987 09:37:05.59"},"7090":{"title":"METRO FUNDING SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE MERGER","body":"<Metro Funding Corp> said its\nshareholders approved its merger into <Maxcom Corp> and its\nchange of incorporation from Nevada to Delaware.\n    Metro Funding also said its subsidiary, Comet Corp, will be\nrenamed Maxcom USA.\n    The company also reported shareholders approved the\nauthorization of 500,000 shares of common stock to be set aside\nfor an incentive stock option plan.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-MAR-1987 09:37:54.32","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"7091":{"title":"HITACHI <HIT> UNIT LAUNCHES NEW FLOPPY DISK","body":"Hitachi Ltd's Maxell Corp of\nAmerica introduced a floppy disk with expanded storage\ncapacity.\n    The company said the 5-1/4-inch disk has a storage capacity\nof 3.2 megabytes unformatted, and is in response to user demand\nfor higher capacity media for newly introduced machines and\ndrives.\n    Maxell said the disk will operate with the newly developed\nYD-801 drive, to be produced by Y-E Data Inc, Tokyo, and\nplanned for introduction later this year in the U.S.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-MAR-1987 09:38:18.49","places":["usa"]},"7092":{"title":"BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINMENT CORP <BBEC> YEAR LOSS","body":"Oper shr loss 1.25 dlrs vs loss 44 cts\n    Oper net loss 2,915,000 vs loss 951,000\n    Revs 8,131,000 vs 119,000\n    NOTE: 1985 net excludes 625,000 dlr gain from discontinued\noperations.\n    Net includes tax credits of 860,000 dlrs vs 285,000 dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-MAR-1987 09:38:42.18","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"7093":{"title":"TELECOM <TELE> SAYS SALE CLOSING DELAYED","body":"Telecom Plus International Inc\nsaid the closing of the sale of its 65 pct interest in Tel Plus\nCommunications Inc to <Siemens AG> has been delayed.\n    The company said it will be continuing its talks with\nSiemens and based on current circumstances believes the\ntransaction could close next week.\n    Closing had been scheduled for March 16.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-MAR-1987 09:39:01.53","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"7094":{"title":"JEFFERIES <JEFG> CHAIRMAN PLEADING GUILTY, QUITS","body":"Jefferies Group Inc said founder\nand chairman Boyd L.

This time next year, the U.S. will be\nscreaming at those countries about their exports,\" said Steve\nCerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.\n    Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S.\nafter Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.\n    Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress,\nthe Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric\nagainst Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their\ncurrencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.\n    The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized\ncountries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the\ncurrencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main\nfocus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to\nclose the competiveness gap for American goods.\n    U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he\nexpects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year.\n    But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their\nown doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not\nrisen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries\nof soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and\nKorean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack.\n    \"In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was\nJapan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing,\" said Robert Chandross, of\nLloyds Bank PLC.\n    Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore\nand Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170\nbillion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.\n    The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in\n1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade\ndeficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.\n    And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is\ncontinuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6\nbillion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The\ngap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.\n    Lately both nations have said they will take steps to\ndefuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many\nof the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import\ntariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.\n    Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last\nweek that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to\nfive years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.\n    For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut\ntariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and\ntry to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang\nChien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect\nTaiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.\n    The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles\nand electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the\narea of \"big-ticket\" manufactured goods, notably cars.\n    Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America\n-- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.\n    \"The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When\ntheir exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing\nbase. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,\" said Bob\nWendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.\n    The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports,\n72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its\ntelecommunications equipment.\n    A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and\nSouth Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.\n    While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the\nU.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.\n    But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in\nmarked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into\nlarge bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade\nand current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.\n    Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to\n18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and\nKorea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.\n    Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.\n    \"A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been\nat Japan's expense,\" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.\n    February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers\nexorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.\n    But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response\nfrom the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work\nwith a sizeable lag, economists say.\n    The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and\nKorea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is\npegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since\nSeptember 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.\n    But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against\nthe U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.\n    \"We've not seen any lessening of competition from those\ncountries that we can attribute to currency changes,\" said\nBethlehem Steel's Wendt.\n    And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their\nhefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.\n    Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will\nget given the administration's free-trade stance. \"It's hard to\nsee that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then\nthe question is, will it have teeth?\" one economist said.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-MAR-1987 10:42:17.15","topics":["trade"],"places":["usa","taiwan","south-korea","hong-kong","singapore"]},"7136":{"title":"RANK XEROX <XRX> TO SELL SOUTH AFRICAN UNIT","body":"Xerox Corp's U.K. unit, Rank Xerox\nLtd, said it agreed in principle to sell its South African\ncompany, Rank Xerox South Africa Pty Ltd, to <Altron Group's>\nFintech unit.\n    Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n    Altron said the acquisition was key to making Fintech an\noffice systems company.\n    The South African Rank Xerox unit sells copiers and\nduplicators throughout South Africa and in Namibia (South West\nAfrica).

voluntary\nplant closures drawn up by the industry lobby group Eurofer\nwhich it calculates would cost around 22,000 jobs.\n    Diplomats said that in their initial reactions to the\nscheme, most

mln tonnes,\nprovided the companies concerned can be fully repaid by the EC\nor national governments for redundancy and other social costs.\n    But EC Executive Commission sources said Industry\nCommissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes told ministers today that 30 mln\ntonnes of annual capacity was excess to requirements and should\nbe closed by the end of 1990.\n    He said the Eurofer plan in particular fails to pinpoint\nthe scope for closure in heavy hot-rolled wide-strip products,\ntypically produced in plants employing thousands of people.\n    The sources said no minister challenged Narjes' analysis\nthat four or five hot-rolled wide-strip lines would have to\nclose.\n    They said ministers agreed that the Eurofer plan should be\nexpanded and developed through meetings among the industry\nbody, the Commission and representatives of member states.\n    However, diplomats said it was clear from today's\ndiscussions that such meetings will be difficult.\n    They said member states are split on whether to reduce the\nscope of a quota production system, which at present protects\nEC steelmakers from the full force of competition for 65 pct of\ntheir products, while talks on the closure plan proceed.\n    It was also clear that there will be tough talks on which\nEC member states should bear the brunt of the closures and on\nhow much funding for help to those thrown out of work should\ncome from Community coffers.\n    German minister Martin Bangemann said his country's steel\nindustry, the largest in the EC, should not

Chairman Sir\nPhilip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986\nhad made the period extremely difficult but the company had\ncome through remarkably well.\n    Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the\nconditions would be right for a substantially improved\nperformance this year.\n    He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when\nthey were normally weaker, made him \"a bit encouraged\" about the\nprospects for future levels.\n    Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price\nstayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.\n    Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement\nof a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the\nlatter part of April.\n    End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared\nwith 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this\nincluded a revised definition of reserves.\n    If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the\nreserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels\npreviously.\n    Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a\nrestated 3,660 billion.\n\u0003","date":"19-MAR-1987 11:16:35.27","topics":["crude","earn","nat-gas"],"places":["uk"]},"7175":{"title":"GTE <GTE> SELLS DEBENTURES YIELDING 8.737 PCT","body":"GTE Corp is raising 250 mln dlrs\nthrough an offering of debentures due 2017 yielding 8.737 pct,\nsaid sole underwriter UBS Securities Inc.\n    UBS, the U.S. unit of Union Bank of Switzerland, won the\nissue in competitive bidding against syndicates led by such\nmajor U.S. houses as First Boston and Morgan Stanley.\n    UBS has become the second foreign firm to manage an issue\nin the domestic debt market this year, following Daiwa\nSecurities America Inc.

ATT does not offer\ncomputerized information services.\n    ATT has asked the Federal Communications Commission, in a\nseparate proceeding, to reduce price and rate regulations that\nhave dominated the long-distance business for many years.\n    Greene is expected to reach a decision on whether to ease\nrestrictions this year, possibly this summer, analysts said.\n    \"The restrictions prevent people who can provide services\nfrom providing them,\" said a congressional aide.\n    However, a major concern among consumer groups and\nlawmakers is that the companies may subsidize those new\nbusinesses from higher charges to their customers.\n    \"We're talking about activities funded directly or\nindirectly off the backs of ratepayers,\" said Moir.\n    One congressional aide said he was not worried about\nsubsidizing new businesses from profits, but he was concerned\nthat the Bell companies may overcharge consumers so that they\ncan invest in new services.\n    Some analysts said accounting regulations would protect\nconsumers against cross-subsidization by the Bell companies.\n    \"Those are types of things that really do need review,\" said\nGerry Salemme, an aide with the House Telecommunications,\nConsumer Protection and Finance Subcommittee.\n    He added that the House would hold hearings later this year\nto examine the potential effects of reduced restrictions.\n    Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation, which represents\nmore than 200 consumer groups, said accounting regulations were\ninadequate because accountants could not separate equipment\nemployed for traditional and new services.\n    \"We have yet to see adequate regulatory safeguards that\nexist that prevent cross-subsidization by the Bell companies,\"\nKimmelman said. \"You're either asking for great increases in\nrates or a great opportunity for cross-subsidization.\"\n    One congressional aide expressed concern that lifting of\nthe restrictions would lead to joint ventures between U.S. and\nforeign firms in manufacturing telecommunications equipment and\nthat could lead to a loss of American jobs.

Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD), reached agreement over the central elements of a new\naccord last weekend.\n    Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of\n201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kilo -- and indicative\nprices set in the present pact.\n    Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint\nMalaysian/Singapore currency, he added.\n    The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of\nprice ranges -- the \"may sell\" and \"may buy\" points at plus and\nminus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the \"must sell\"\nand \"must buy\" zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it.\n    Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that\nwere set in the present accord. \"The most important of these are\nto stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between\ndemand and supply,\" he said.

Czarnikow says in its\nlatest sugar review.\n    The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very\nnominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the\nintervention price, with detrimental consequences for\nproducers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an\nattempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered\nsugar.\n    The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade\nproducers from their chosen course, such as removing the time\nlimit on storage contracts, which presently means that\nintervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September,\nCzarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production\nquotas being reduced.\n    If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for\nexport, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at\nrecent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference\nbetween the EC price and the world market price, the extra\ncosts might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says.\n    The producers might have to repay these costs through\nproduction levies and the proposed special elimination levy,\nCzarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs\ncould be recovered under EC rules.\n    The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of\nsugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the\nEC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to\nbridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price,\nCzarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of\nprotest designed to force the Commission's hand.\n    In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for\nintervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure\nthat the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in\n1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price,\nWest German producers face a further price reduction in July\nwith a probable revaluation of the \"green\" mark.\n    Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is\nnot expected to disappear permanently.

It is restricted to new offshore developments\noutside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.\n    A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not\npaying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly\nbenefit in PRT saving on an existing field.\n    \"The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators\nin those fields which have no PRT liability,\" the report said,\nadding that the timing of development of such fields may be\nadvanced.\n    The government would in effect be subsidising these\ndevelopments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before\ncorporation tax, the report said.\n    On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is\nof timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will\nbe reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will\nrise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.\n    In a study on probable fields, the report said that when\nthe rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying\nfield such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the\nU.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a\nsmall non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9\npct.\n    The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will\nbe a cost in being able to have this early relief.

The 1987 loan rate is\ntoo high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of\nsoybean production in South America, he said. At the same time,\nthe U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income\nsupport for soybean farmers, Haggard said.\n    \"We need some kind of market loan,\" he added.\n    The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture\nSecretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA\nso far has resisted pressure to use the authority.\n    Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA,\nbut Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they\nwould seriously consider offering a marketing loan.\n    USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the\nsoybean situation is a \"dilemna\" which has been studied\nextensively by the department. But he did not say what, if any\nchanges, are under consideration.\n    In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways other\nthan a marketing loan which should be considered to help\nsoybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment,\nor a direct payment program.\n    Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity Credit\nCorporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will rise\nto 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu of\nsoybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year.\n    \"Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil's entire\nsoybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987,\" Haggard said.\n    However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious in\nmaking soybean program changes that might allow the European\nCommunity to challenge the U.S. program under the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.\n    He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybean\nproduction and loss of that market would be devastating.\n    The Reagan administration has given \"mixed signals\" on\nwhether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be\nsuccessfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said.\n    While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per bu\nloan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorsed\na proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a six\ndlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan.\n    The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking\nRepublican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep.

be signed in New York tomorrow amid increasing calls from\nboth creditors and debtors for a streamlining of the tortuous\nprocess of raising such jumbo loans, bankers said.\n    Pressure for change has mounted because the Mexican deal\nhas been even more difficult to syndicate than bankers feared.\n    Several tentative signing dates had to be scrapped and even\nnow, five months after the loan was agreed with a 13-bank\nadvisory committee on October 16, dozens of Mexico's some 400\ncreditor banks worldwide are still refusing to participate.\n    The resistance to the deal must be seen alongside the fact\nthat it is the largest loan for a Latin American debtor since\nthe region's debt crisis flared up in 1983. Mexico will also\nsign agreements to reschedule 52.3 billion dlrs of debt.\n    Moreover, as the first major package built on U.S. Treasury\nSecretary James Baker's strategy of offering loans to countries\nwilling to implement market-oriented, pro-growth policies,\nintense market scrutiny was only to be expected.\n    Still, the split within the banks' ranks came as a shock.\n\"This is not an unsuccessful operation, but we've had more\nbickering than ever,\" one senior banker commented.\n    Officers at small banks that have sold, swapped or or\nwritten down their Mexican loans say they see no reason why\nthey should throw good money after bad.\n    Major lenders counter that small banks must share the\nresponsibility of making new loans and cannot expect to keep\nreceiving interest on old debt unless they join in new ones.\n    Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford said\nrecently the reluctance of small banks at one point endangered\nthe entire Mexican package. Things have improved, but money\ncenter bankers are determined to keep hounding recalcitrant\nbanks even once the 7.7 billion dlr target has been reached.\n    The loan presently is about 98.5 pct committed. \"People who\nare outside shouldn't think they've been saved once we get over\n7.7 (billion dlrs),\" one warned.\n    But rounding up \"free-rider\" banks entails such a huge\ndrain on management resources that more and more bankers are\nacknowledging that the syndicates may have to shrink.\n    One idea is to levy new loan contributions on the basis of\ncurrent exposure instead of outstandings at an earlier \"base\"\ndate - August 1982 in the case of Mexico. Another streamlining\nidea is to allow small banks to escape by swapping their loans\nfor \"exit bonds\" that a debtor would issue at a discount.\n    Argentina has pressed for this solution, so far to no\navail, arguing that the smallest 120 of its 360 bank creditors\naccount for just one pct of its foreign bank debt and that the\nnext 120 banks account only for a further six pct.\n    Central bank president Jose Luis Machinea said Argentina\nmay not receive the 2.15 billion dlrs in bank loans it is\nseeking until September, which would be a year after\nnegotiations began with the International Monetary Fund.\n    The protracted negotiations have damaged the confidence of\ninvestors in Argentina, forcing up interest rates and spurring\ncapital flight, he said.\n    \"We have to introduce some common sense into the\ndiscussion,\" Machinea said this week in Cambridge, Mass.\n    He was echoed by Mexico's deputy planning minister, Pedro\nAspe Armella, who said the delay in signing his country's loan\nhas made it difficult to map economic policy with any\ncertainty. \"It's a sad affair,\" he told the Cambridge meeting.\n    Bankers said Mexico became so frustrated with the delay in\nthe loan that it suspended its debt-equity swap program last\nmonth to put pressure on the banks. Other strains have\nintensified between U.S. and non-U.S. banks, partly because\nU.S. regulations and accounting rules discourage writedowns.\n    Critics say this prompts U.S. banks to focus too much on\nensuring steady interest payments from debtors in the short\nterm, possibly to the detriment of longer-term solutions.\n    Because more than half of the banks baulking at the Mexican\ndeal are American, some foreign bankers think other U.S. banks\nshould make up the difference.\n    This issue of \"national share\" was defused on the Mexican\ncommittee but bankers say it will probably recur in talks with\nArgentina and Brazil, whose finance minister Dilson Funaro has\nalready suggested separate negotiations with regional\ncommittees of creditors.\n    Streamlining of the new-money process is running parallel\nwith efforts to develop a broader \"menu\" of alternatives to new\nloans, such as trade credits or debt-equity conversions.\n    \"We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devising\nnew money packages may, in effect, be essential to future bank\nsyndications,\" Mulford said last week.

Its record losses have been caused by\nits past status as one of the nation's top lenders to oil and\ngas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late\n1970s and early 1980s.\n    First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudential\ncame from its Energy Finance Co., an entity formed in 1982 to\nloan money to \"more venturesome\" oil borrowers that promised a\nhigher potential return. The other half of the loans were from\nFirst City's lead bank in Houston.\n    Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co., said\nthe sale of the package of energy loans was the first\nencouraging news from First City in months.\n    \"It's not going to solve all of First City's problems but\nit's a good transaction for them. It may be possible for them\nto sell additional loans,\" Kotowski said. \"Prudential can fund\nthese things more cheaply than First City and there's an\nincentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now as\nvalues are depressed\"\n    In a statement, First City chairman J.A. Elkins said the\nbank's strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans to\ntotal loans. \"This move, which we believe is the first\ntransaction of its kind, helps us further, and we were able to\nmake it without suffering a loss.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"20-MAR-1987 11:21:57.17","topics":["earn","crude"],"places":["usa"]},"7743":{"title":"SUNSHINE MINING CO 4TH QTR SHR LOSS 64 CTS VS LOSS 57 CTS\n","date":"20-MAR-1987 11:22:52.46","topics":["earn"]},"7744":{"date":"20-MAR-1987 11:23:32.79","topics":["ipi"],"places":["italy"]},"7745":{"title":"STANDARD OIL <SRD> LEASES CRAY <CYR> COMPUTER","body":"Cray Research Inc said\nStandard Oil Production Co, a Dallas-based subsidiary of\nStandard Oil Co, will lease its CRAY X-MP/28 supercomputer with\nan SSD solid state storage device.\n    The leased system will be installed in the second quarter\nof 1987 and replace a CRAY X-MP/24 computer system in operation\nsince 1984, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"20-MAR-1987 11:23:49.51","places":["usa"]},"7746":{"title":"GRACO INC <GGG> VOTES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND","body":"Qtly div 15 cts vs 15 cts prior qtr\n    Pay 6 May\n    Record 8 April\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"20-MAR-1987 11:23:54.77","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"7747":{"title":"AUDIO/VIDEO <AVA> SUES OVER CYCLOPS <CYL> BID","body":"Audio/Video Affiliates Inc said it\nhas filed suit against <Dixons Group PLC>, Cyclops Corp,\nAlleghany Corp <Y> and others in connection with Dixons'\nrecently completed tender offer in which it raised its\nownership of Cyclops to 56 pct.\n    The company said the suit, filed in U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of Ohio, seeks a temporary restraining\norder and preliminary injunction requiring Dixons, for 10\nbusiness days, to permit any Cyclops shareholder who previously\ntendered and now wishes to withdraw to do so.\n    The company said the order and injunction would also\nprohibit Dixons from exercising a \"lockup\" option granted it by\nCyclops and prohibit Dixons for 10 business days from\nattempting to exercise any control over Cyclops.\n    Audio/Video said the suit also requests the court to order\nCyclops to immediately provide to all potential bidders for\nCyclops all information given to Dixons.\n    Audio/Video and Citicorp <CCI> have been tendering for all\nCyclops shares in a competing offer at 80.00 dlrs per share but\nsaid it could raise its bid to 92.50 dlrs under certain\ncircumstances.

The loan will be 100 pct guaranteed by SACE, the\nofficial Italian export credit agency.\n    Morgan Grenfell has used special purpose vehicles in the\npast to help refinance export credits for other indebted\ncountries, such as Brazil and Ecuador.\n    The Brazil financing, for example, involved the use of a\nfloating rate note. This transaction makes use of another\nsector of the capital markets -- that for short-term note\nfacilities -- to finance a medium term credit.\n    The financing is being arranged in connection with a\nbilateral agreement between Mexico and SACE earlier this year\nto refinance Mexico's official debt to Italy.\n    The bilateral accord followed a multilateral rescheduling\nagreement reached last September of Mexico's official debt to\nthe Paris Club of western creditor governments.\n    The Paris Club accord, in turn, was part of a broad-based\nrescheduling package covering 77 billion dlrs of Mexico's\nforeign debt.\n    That package -- heralded as the first to incorporate all\naspects of U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's plan to aid\nindebted countries -- included a 7.7 billion dlr loan, which\nwas signed today in New York.\n     The new financing for\nItalfunding, being syndicated among about five major\ninternational banks, will be a fully underwritten, revolving\nfacility with an average life of seven years and the facility\nwill fund the loan.\n    All Paris Club agreements contain a generally accepted\noutline for a rescheduling, but the specific terms must then be\nnegotiated on a bilateral basis.\n    Banking sources noted that the use of a special-purpose\nvehicle will provide Mexico with particularly attractive\nfinancing at a rate of about 1/4 to 1/2 pct over the London\nInterbank Offered Rate (Libor).\n    The cost of the new financing compares with a spread of\n13/16 pct on the loans in the new commercial bank package.\n    This is because the intermediary providing the funds, in\nthis case Italfunding, can obtain its funds relatively cheaply\non the international markets. At the same time, the deal\nbenefits the banks, which will still get a reasonable return on\nthe note facility, which is pure Italian risk.\n    The bankers noted that if the financing had been

Prices have fallen so far\nthat only about five firms still make markets in them.\n    The Westpac perpetual notes are technically now the\nproperty of a newly formed single-purpose finance subsidiary,\nPacific Securities. If Morgan tried to find a home for the\nactual Westpac notes, as is, they would be paid no more than 85\ncents on the dollar, at most, traders said.\n    But the repackaging allows them to target a new class of\ninvestor for the notes and take the old issues off their books\nwithout registering a loss, the traders said.\n    \"The only one the repackaging favours is Morgan,\" a trader\nsaid.\n    Meanwhile, the end-holders of perpetual notes, most of whom\nare Japanese banks, must still find a way to value them by\nyear-end, now a week away.\n    From Morgan's point of view, the repackaging does aid the\npresent holders of the notes as well as offering value to a new\nclass of investors.\n    \"At least we've put a floor under the price of the notes.\nWe've created a way to set a real value for them,\" one Morgan\nofficial said. Morgan had earlier attempted, but abandoned,\nanother plan to repackage the Westpac securities.\n    Morgan's holdings of Westpac paper create special problems\nfor it because of the way U.S. Regulators view bank holdings of\nthe primary capital of other banks, traders said. Therefore, it\nis crucial that a vehicle for selling the paper be found.\n    And indeed, note traders said, the FRN portion of the\nrepackaged securities -- which Westpac has offered to redeem\nfor cash in 15 years -- does have real value.\n    For one thing, traders noted, it pays about the highest\nrate over the London Interbank Offered Rate of virtually any\nnewly issued security. The spread is 50 basis points.\n    However, the other portion of the security, in which the\ninvestor pays 20 cents on the dollar for a zero coupon 15-year\nbond, is of dubious value unless the Westpac perpetual assumes\na market value near par 15 years from now, traders said.\n    The zero-coupon portion could provide value for an account\nwhich for tax purposes, wants to take a large capital loss, the\ntraders said. In the 15-year period between the time the note\nis purchased and the time it is redeemed, no interest is paid.\n    When repayment finally occurs, it is not in cash like an\nordinary zero-coupon bond.

A lot\nwill depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of the\ntroubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting.\"\n    Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably\nprevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat\ngrowing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus\nreceived on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said.\n    The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record\nlows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its\ntoll on Soviet winter crops, she said.\n    However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt had\nample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majority\nof crop areas from severe frost damage.\n    The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains\nin the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily from\nCanada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia,\nMartell said.\n    She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop\nproblems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.\n    Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing on\nmoisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weather\nnecessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.\n    Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986\ngrain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobyl\naccident may have contaminated more grain than originally\nthought and have to be made up with imports.\n    However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last\nresort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have only\njust recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the\n1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.\n    Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980\ngrain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the\nUSSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.\n    In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain\nimports of 55.5 mln tonnes.
