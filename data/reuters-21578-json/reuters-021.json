If vital supplies were cut off,\nTehran could not continue the war with Iraq.\n    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic\ninitiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an\narms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.\n    He said the United States should also threaten to mine and\nblockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to\nacknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a\nsettlement.\n    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by\ninvading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the\noutbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style\ninfantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.\n    Each side has attacked the others' shipping.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-OCT-1987 15:35:53.55","topics":["crude","ship"],"places":["bahrain","iran","usa"]},"21003":{"title":"CCR VIDEO SAYST RECEIVED OFFER TO NEGOTIATE A TAKEOVER BY INTERCEP INVESTMENT CORP\n","date":"19-OCT-1987 15:34:40.05","topics":["acq"]},"21004":{"title":"GM <GM> CANADA UNIT MAJOR OFFER ACCEPTED BY UNION","body":"The Canadian Auto Workers' Union said it\naccepted an economic offer from the Canadian division of\nGeneral Motors Corp <GM> in contract negotiations.\n    But union president Bob White said many local issues at the\n11 plants in Ontario and Quebec still remained unresolved ahead\nof Thursday's deadline for a strike by 40,000 workers.\n    \"It minimizes the possibility of a strike,\" White told\nreporters.\n    However, \"if we don't have local agreements settled by\nThursday, there will be a strike,\" he said.\n    The local issues still unresolved involved health care,\nskilled trades and job classifications, White said.\n    GM Canada negotiator Rick Curd said he believed a strike\nwould be avoided.\n    \"Even though there are some tough issues to be resolved\nwe're on the right schedule to meet the target,\" Curd said.\n    \"I'm very pleased with the state of the negotiations,\" he\nsaid.\n    Union membership meetings have been scheduled for the\nweekend in case a tentative settlement, said White.\n    White said the union has also received assurances that a\njob protection pact negotiated with GM workers in the U.S. does\nnot threaten Canadian jobs.\n    The economic offer for a three-year pact largely matches\nagreements at Ford <F> and Chrysler <C> in Canada, which\ninclude inflation-indexed payments for future retirees and\nfixed annual payments for current retirees.\n    It also gives workers wage increases of three pct\nimmediately and 1.5 pct in each of the second and third years.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-OCT-1987 15:32:25.38","places":["canada"]},"21005":{"title":"CANADA DEVELOPMENT UNIT <CDC.TO> REFINANCES","body":"Canada Development Corp said its\n<Polysar Ltd> unit completed a refinancing package worth about\n830 mln Canadian dlrs.\n    The company said the financing, which involves 24 banks \nand four syndicated loans, consists of a 380 mln Canadian dlr\nrevolver, a 200 mln Canadian dlr European medium term loan, a\n149 mln Canadian dlr revolver and a 100 mln Canadian dlr\noperating loan.\n    The company said the refinancing will reduce borrowing\ncosts, in addition to having other benefits.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-OCT-1987 15:32:11.59","places":["canada"]},"21006":{"title":"DIPLOMATS CALL U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG RESTRAINED","body":"A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform\nin the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid\ncarefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab\nallies, Western diplomats in the region said.\n    U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that\nU.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf\nin response to a missile strike on the American-registered\nKuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.\n    \"We consider the matter closed,\" he said, a signal the U.S.\nadministration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.\n    Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day\nagainst exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action\nwould endanger American interests.\n    Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War\nInformation Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a\n\"crushing blow.\"\n    \"The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in\nno way get out safely,\" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.\n    Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid\nostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on\nNovember 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.\n    Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in\nDamascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in\npreventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.\n    Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab\nstates could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they\nsaid.\n    \"The ball is in Iran's court now.

That was down\nfrom the prior week's tally of slightly more than two billion\ndlrs of new debt.\n    In contrast, a year ago it was not unusual to see those\namounts of new offerings in a single day as companies took\nadvantage of the then decline in interest rates to refinance\nold, higher-cost debt or to expand operations via financings at\nlow, attractive rates, underwriters noted.\n    \"Companies will conduct financings that they believe are\nessential,\" said an underwriter with a medium-sized Wall Street\nfirm. \"But we will not see much more than that until the market\nstabilizes.\"\n    In the meantime, treasurers will probably prefer shorter\nterm issues, analysts said.

This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\npublicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetary\npolicy. He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilise\ncurrencies was still working, but added: \"On the other hand, we\nwill not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interest\nrates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the United\nStates will raise rates.\"\n    Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) in\nZurich said: \"The situation is very dangerous. Statements by the\nU.S. Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates.\"\n    Herbert Fritschi, director of Zurich Cantonal Bank's\nfinancial research department, called the sell-off \"overdone,\"\nbut warned that the situation could worsen unless central banks\nloosen their monetary policy.\n    \"I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over,\" he\nsaid. \"The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step in\nwith an easy money policy, or else there is going to be an\neconomic catastrophe. They have to act quickly.\"\n    Wyttenbach said the \"Black Monday\" sell-off was clearly\nexaggerated, with Swiss Reinsurance Co participation\ncertificates falling 20 pct in value at one point.\n    But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correction\nwould come soon. First, the bad news will reach small investors\nonly in time for tomorrow's market, when there could be\nanother, smaller selling wave.\n    \"As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key --\nthen we'll get a strong movement upward,\" Wyttenbach said. But\nthat may not come soon.\n    \"People are simply worried that in America, where the market\nhas now fallen by 18 pct since August, the bull market is over,\"\nhe said. \"People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988.\"\n    Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the current\nproblems and the weak dollar, Wyttenbach said. \"We do not have a\nmark problem, we have a dollar problem,\" he added, but said the\nbiggest culprit was the new chairman of the U.S. Federal\nReserve Board, Alan Greenspan.\n    Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that the\ndollar might be too high in the medium term and that interest\nrates might have to rise. \"As a central banker he shouldn't do\nthat,\" Wyttenbach said. \"There is a danger that we will fall back\ninto the 1970s,\" he said. \"We have a real crisis of confidence in\nGreenspan. I would much rather have a Volcker.\"\n    Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11.\n    Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: \"I'm relatively optimistic\nbecause the situation looks too bad. The Fed certainly has to\nintervene.\"\n    He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to take\nany significant steps, adding that the focus of attention\nremains on the United States.\n    \"The panic started in New York, it has to end there.\"\n    The Cantonal Bank sent an advisory to customers suggesting\nthey not sell into a panicked market, but wait a while before\ndeciding what to do.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"19-OCT-1987 10:08:30.32","topics":["money-fx","interest"],"places":["switzerland","west-germany"]},"21423":{"title":"SOVIET UNION SETS 4.5 PCT INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT GROWTH","body":"Soviet Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told\nthe Supreme Soviet (parliament) industrial output is planned to\nrise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987.\n    In the first nine months of this year, industrial output\nrose by 3.6 pct.\n    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent\nto gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pct\nagainst a planned 4.1 pct this year.\n    He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in\n1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year.\n    The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986\nand the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected the\nharvest this year.\n    Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineering\nindustry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described\nas a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if the\nSoviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets.\n    \"Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the\nmachine-building industry.

For years the softly-spoken economist has been\nwarning in speech after speech that excessive money supply\ngrowth would eventually lead to rising prices.\n    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank\ncouncil, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his\nviews, bankers said.\n    \"Poehl is in a minority in his own house,\" said Commerzbank's\nPfister.\n    \"Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not\nentirely his own,\" said another economist.\n    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,\nthey will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark\nand hurting West German exporters.\n    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the\nBundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.\n    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James\nBaker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.\n    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986\nwar of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.\nOfficials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to\nstimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.\n    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round\nof tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.\n    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for\nStoltenberg than he had bargained for.\n    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted\nmost popular government politician last year, had to face\nresistance from local barons in the government coalition\nparties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.\n    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising\n4.3 billion marks.\n    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will\npush up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the\ngovernment could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.\n    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row\nwhich has turned into the country's worst political scandal.\n    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last\nmonth early to sort out a row in the northern state of\nSchleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.\n    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after\nallegations of a \"dirty tricks\" election campaign led to heavy\nlosses for the CDU in state elections.\n    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last\nweekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.\n    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more\nremarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and\nwas appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.\n    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this\nyear, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government\ngave Poehl another eight-year term.\n    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he\nhoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.\n    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was\nnot only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the\nBundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"19-OCT-1987 07:25:22.85","topics":["money-fx","interest"],"places":["west-germany"]},"21509":{"title":"FLETCHER CHALLENGE SETS PRICE FOR BONUS SHARES","body":"Fletcher Challenge Ltd <FLTC.WE> (FCL)\nannounced a striking price of 5.89 N.Z.

The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt\nand debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.\n    \"The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are\ngoing to take much longer to solve than was originally thought\nis soundly based -- primarily because the government's\nmacro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,\" Bayliss said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"19-OCT-1987 02:35:59.87","topics":["money-fx","nzdlr"],"places":["new-zealand"]},"21562":{"title":"PHILIPPINE TRADE GAP WIDENS IN JANUARY-AUGUST","body":"The Philippines' trade deficit widened to\n542 mln dlrs in the eight months to end-August from 159 mln\ndlrs in the same 1986 period, the National Statistics Office\nsaid.\n    It said exports in the eight-month period rose to 3.58\nbillion dlrs from 3.18 billion in 1986, while imports rose to\n4.12 billion dlrs from 3.34 billion a year earlier.\n    The country's trade deficit totalled 202 mln dlrs in 1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"19-OCT-1987 02:30:11.36","topics":["trade"],"places":["philippines"]},"21563":{"title":"IRAN PRESIDENT DOUBTS U.S. ACTION AGAINST IRAN","body":"Iranian President Ali Khamenei said he\ndoubted the U.S. Was in position to take violent action against\nIran in the Gulf, Tehran Radio reported.\n    The U.S. Government \"is in a very difficult situation now\nand it is not clear if it has the necessary elements for a\nviolent action,\" the radio quoted him as saying in an interview\nwith the English language daily Tehran Times.\n    In Washington, President Ronald Reagan said he had decided\non a response to Iran, which the Americans blame for two\nmissile attacks on U.S.-related tankers in Kuwaiti waters last\nweek, but declined to say what the response was.\n    Khamenei said the U.S. Government had to take some action\nto demonstrate its authority, \"but on the other hand any violent\nact in the Persian Gulf will greatly harm long-term U.S.\nInterests,\" the radio, monitored in Nicosia, reported.\n    On efforts for a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war, Khamenei\nsaid: \"Declaration of the aggressor and a ceasefire should be\nconcurrent.
