The Finance Bill will have provisions for\nthe implementation of measures announced in November, it said.\n    Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers\nWood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs\non PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.\n    He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would\nfavour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields\nsuch Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.\n    Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields\nmight also be encouraged, he said.\n    Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore\nconstruction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs\nunder the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.\n    He pointed out that the relief only applies to the\ndevelopment of new fields outside the Southern Basin.\n    This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the\ncentral and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than\nin the south and thus have greater capital and labour\nrequirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.\n    He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure\nwould help fundamental research in the oil industry, although\nthe benefits of this research would not be seen for several\nyear.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"17-MAR-1987 12:29:35.42","topics":["crude"],"places":["uk"]},"6087":{"title":"TEXAS EASTERN <TET> PLEDGES PCB CLEANUP","body":"Texas Eastern Corp's Texas Eastern\nGas Pipleline unit President Howard C.

Association\nconference current exchange rates of major currencies \"can be\nviewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective.\"\n    He said the recent Paris agreement on currency\nstabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five\nand Canada may herald \"an era of greater exchange rate\nstability.\"\n    The Paris agreement was not, however, an attempt to set up\npermanent target zones for exchange rates, Gleske stressed,\nadding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and\nenforce on an international level.\n    \"At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered\ngrossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and\nthe yen,\" Gleske said.\n    He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies\nof important trading nations such as Canada, Korea, Taiwan and\nHong Kong, and further falls there may still be necessary.\n    But \"a further dollar depreciation against major European\ncurrencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the\ndollar to a fully competitive position, as measured by its\nweighted external value,\" he said.\n   In fact, a further marked decline in the dollar rate would\nhold two major dangers, Gleske said.\n    First, in countries with large balance of payments\nsurpluses such as Japan and West Germany, it threatened to\nhamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real\nincome and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out\nsurpluses.\n    Second, in the United States, it could damage investors'\nconfidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to\nfinance huge fiscal and external payments deficits, Gleske\nsaid.\n    Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international\nsystem of binding target zones for currencies, fluctuating in\nnarrow bands against each other, can be established. Such\ntargets threatened to cause policy conflicts, \"both within\ncountries and between them.\"\n    For instance, the U.S. Reliance on foreign capital to fund\nits deficits requires interest rates there be set at high\nlevels, but domestic considerations call for low ones.\n    If target zones were established, this would put \"pressure\non other countries to reduce their interest rates even more,\neven though this may be in conflict with their own domestic\nsituation and priorities,\" he said.\n    Gleske added, \"targeting the exchange rate even within a\nwide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a\nclearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and\nexternal policy priorities.\"\n    Commenting on the Paris currency accord, Gleske said its\nchances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current\ninterest rate differentials being maintained.\n    These chances \"seem to me to rest critically on the\nexpectation that the current configuration of interest rates,\nand the monetary policies behind them, will assure smooth\nfinancing of current account imbalances in the months ahead.\"\n    Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had\nlearned \"that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus\ntend to overshoot.\" He said this \"would seem to be unnecessary\nand should be avoided if at all possible.\"\n    Monetary policies can help achieve this, but only if\nmarkets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will\nlead to balanced international payments, he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"17-MAR-1987 13:01:50.02","topics":["dlr","money-fx"],"places":["uk","japan","canada","west-germany","usa"]},"6109":{"title":"U.S. SUBCOMMITEE APPROVES INTERNATIONAL DEBT BILL","body":"A House Banking subcommittee\napproved legislation which would require the Treasury Secretary\nto begin negotiations on the establishment of an international\ndebt adjustment facility.\n    The facility would buy up some of the debt of less\ndeveloped countries and sell it to banks at a discount.\n    The facility was proposed by Rep.

A\nfollow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.\n    \"Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,\" Peter Fellner,\nU.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. \"It was\na very, very prudent fiscal budget.\"\n    Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a\nwell-balanced budget within the confines of the government's\nphilosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.\n    Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal\nside, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.\n    As was widely expected, Lawson split his \"fiscal adjustment\"\nbetween trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg\nfrom 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to\n27 pct.\n    The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was\nkept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad\nSterling M3 aggregate was dropped.\n    Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for\na half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the\nauthorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.\nMany analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full\none-point cut tomorrow.\n    \"The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which\nit will have to reverse later,\" Jeffrey said, though he added a\nfurther half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.\n    The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for\ninflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained\nin it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.\n    Holt noted the \"rather loose\" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct\nat end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result\nfrom the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.\n    \"A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,\"\nhe said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of\nfalling base rates would have an offsetting impact on\ninflation.\n    The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but\nit was \"not a good budget for inflation,\" he said\n    Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about\nthe dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not\ntoo concerned about a revival of inflation.\n    Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the\n\"leading edge\" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were\nlikely to be extremely cautious on this front.\n    He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest\nrates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any\nsigns of excessive weakness.\n    Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility\nof the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.\n    Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from\n1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,\nwhich are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.\nthat the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by\nthe favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast\nto be 4.0 billion stg.\n    But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any\nclear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,\nwhich has to be held before June, 1988.\n    Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the\nbenefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise\nduties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.\n    But others said it kept several options open and it was not\npossible to deduce too much from it.\n    James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,\nLawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in\nthat there would be no \"chickens coming home to roost.\"\n    Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June\nelection, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for\na Budget

But economists said that\nseasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the\neconomy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And\nafter a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.\n    U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a\nseasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804\nmln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April\n1986.\n    The rate at which permits were issued for future building\nclimbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764\nmln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.\n    \"February's weather is usually more adverse for home\nbuilding. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to\ndetermine what this means for the economy down the road,\" said\nAllan Leslie of Discount Corp.\n    The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for\nweather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures\ninflate the statistics.\n    Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to\nbuilding last month. But several believe that rates will now\nconsolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.\n    \"Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying\n'Let's do it now',\" said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of\nSavings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much\nof the financing for home building.\n    But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward\npotential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and \nsome overall improvement in the U.S. economy.\n    He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early\nsummer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last\nNovember, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.\n    As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in\nthe single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which\ntypically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high\nvacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units\nfollowing tax law changes effective January 1.\n    Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317\nmln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate.\n    \"Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low\nmortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably not\nlooking at a great deal of growth potential,\" said Ward\nMcCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n    McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with\nlarger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial\noutput and retail sales in February, may cause some observers\nto start waving \"four pct GNP banners\" for the first quarter.\nGross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter.\n    But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to\ncome in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not\nconvinced that growth will pick up in future.\n    \"The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on\nnow, not all of which is intentional,\" he said. For example,\nU.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks,\nproduced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February\ncompared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln.\n    Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first\nquarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker\ngrowth in the second, he said.\n    \"If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building\nand we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then\nthere is the potential for softness in the second quarter,\"\nagreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.

Currently, the tax credit is calculated against a banks\nprofits as a whole.\n    For banks, compliance with the ruling could indeed be a\nnightmare since they don't fund loans on a individual basis.\n    Many of the loans that would be affected by the tax change\nare those to less developed countries, such as those in Latin\nAmerica. Bankers could not estimate how many loans were\ninvolved expect to suggest it was a \"sizable number.\"\n    In a statement, the Inland Revenue said that on loans made\non or after April 1, the new measures would apply to interest\narising from that date. On existing loans at that date, the\nmeasures would apply to interest arising from April 1, 1988.\n    Government sources noted that the existing treatment of\nwithholding tax on interest has enabled some banks to reduce\ninterest rates on overseas loans, thereby lowering the revenue\nto the U.K. Treasury.\n    The new measures, they said, are designed to  reduce the\nsubsidy given to overseas lending through the tax system and\nbring the U.K. System more into line with those of overseas\ncompetitors.\n    The Inland Revenue estimated that the income to the\nTreausry would be negligible in 1987/88 but could build up over\ntime from about 20 mln stg in 1988/89 to 60 mln stg in 1990/91.\n    But while compliance with the new measures could\nnecessitate hours of clerical work, bankers said the end return\nto the Treasury may not prove as lucrative as anticipated.\n    They noted that most documentation accompanying these loans\ncontains a clause allowing for a loan to be restructured if the\ntax treatment changes. However, they were unsure to what extent\nthe loans would and could be changed.\n    Bankers said they would seek clarification from the Inland\nRevenue, particularly on how to calculate the cost of these\nloans. Revenue said it hopes to keep costs of compliance to a\nminimum.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"17-MAR-1987 16:08:55.07","places":["uk"]},"6263":{"title":"U.S. TO SELL 12.8 BILLION DLRS IN BILLS","body":"The U.S. Treasury said it will sell\n12.8 billion dlrs of three and six-month bills at its regular\nauction next week.\n    The March 23 sale, to be evenly divided between the three\nand six month issues, will result in a paydown of 2.875 billion\ndlrs as maturing bills total 15.68 billion dlrs.\n    The bills will be issued March 26.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"17-MAR-1987 16:09:21.34","places":["usa"]},"6264":{"title":"SENATOR SAYS ENERGY REPORT ASSUMPTIONS FLAWED","body":"Sen.

Similarily, the West has no interest to see Zaire's\nstrategic minerals fall into communist hands,\" the diplomat\nsaid.\n    Zaire defied its creditors late last year by saying it\nwould limit repayments on its five billion dlr external debt to\n10 pct of its export earnings from January 1987.\n    The government also announced an end to the floating\nexchange rate for the zaire currency and a return to a fixed\nparity against special drawing rights (SDRs) with periodic\nadjustments.\n    Until last year, Zaire devoted up to 28 pct of its export\nrevenue to servicing large foreign debts contracted during the\ncopper boom of the 1970's to finance largely non-productive and\noften extravagant investment projects.\n    Zaire, the world's leading cobalt producer and the sixth\nlargest supplier of copper, depends on the two minerals for\ntwo-thirds of its export earnings.\n    \"A young country cannot go on indefinitely sacrificing\neverything for the sake of servicing its external debt,\"\nPresident Mobutu Sese Seko commented in October when he\nannounced his government's decision.\n    As early as January 1986, Mobutu had warned that \"one does\nnot feed on austerity and praise. I have another debt, one\ntoward my people and my people's efforts must not backfire,\" he\ntold diplomats.\n    Zaire pointed out that during four years of IMF-backed\nausterity (1983-86), it had become a net exporter of capital\nwithout receiving appropriate financing from abroad.\n    Economists said that since the large devaluation of the\nzaire currency in September 1983, the country suffered a net\noutflow of 830 mln dlrs each year.\n    Zaire's medium and long term public debt in the past few\nyears reached an equivalent of about 100 pct of its Gross\nNational Product (GNP), one of the highest such ratios in the\nworld, banking sources said.\n    Mobutu accused the IMF of \"strangling\" his country at an\nOctober meeting of the ruling MPR party and said his people\ncould not long endure the hardship caused by austerity.\n    Zairean officials blame their present difficulties on the\nIMF recovery plan's two basic assumptions which, they said,\nfailed to materialise last year,\n    - a world economic recovery pushing up commodity prices and\nboosting Zaire's export revenue and debt servicing capacity,\n    - substantial, additional financial help from the country's\ntraditional donors.\n    In 1983 Zaire set out on a major economic reform aimed at\ncurbing its soaring debt. It floated its currency, slashed\nspending and privatised industry, gaining praise from Western\ncreditors and obtaining debt rescheduling.\n    As a result, the overall economic and financial situation\nimproved markedly, with inflation down to 41 pct last year from\n100 pct in 1983.\n    But it also led to a severe and steady fall in living\nstandards for Zaire's 35 mln population, fuelling widespread\ndiscontent among poorer city dwellers, diplomats said.\n    Economists estimate the drop in purchasing power at between\n20 and 35 pct for an average household over the last 12 months,\ndespite a pay rise of up to 67 pct for civil servants announced\nlast May.\n    The World Bank has released in the last two months half of\na previously-agreed 80 mln dlrs industrial sector loan and lent\n27.6 mln dlrs to modernise the country's vital river transport\nsystem.\n    Belgium, Zaire's former colonial ruler and its main trading\npartner, recently agreed to release a total of 17 mln dlrs to\nease payments difficulties and finance imports of spare parts\nfor industry.\n    A new agreement between the IMF and Zaire would pave the\nway for another debt rescheduling, probably at the next meeting\nof the Paris Club of Western creditor nations, diplomats said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"18-MAR-1987 07:07:24.30","organisations":["imf"],"places":["zaire"]},"6396":{"title":"JAPAN TO ADOPT ITS LARGEST-EVER PROVISIONAL BUDGET","body":"A parliamentary boycott by opposition\nmembers has forced the government to compile its largest-ever\nprovisional budget, finance ministry officials said.\n    The 7,900 billion yen budget for the first 50 days of\nfiscal 1988 starting April exceeds the previous record of 3,040\nbillion yen for an 11-day budget in fiscal 1984.\n    An on-again, off-again parliamentary boycott by opposition\nparties over a proposed five pct sales tax has prevented\npassage of the full 1987/88 budget within the current year\nending March 31.\n    The stop-gap budget, which is expected to pass parliament\non March 31, is designed to respond to mounting calls for\neconomic stimulus from domestic industries, hard hit by the\nyen's sharp rise, officials said.\n    It will include as much as 1,800 billion yen for public\nworks, about 30 pct of the 6,000 billion yen earmarked for such\nworks in the full budget.

The trade had\nexpected deferred contracts to decline on the USDA report of a\n15 pct rise in cattle placements in February from a year ago.\n    Although the heavy placements were expected, analysts noted\nreports that many cattle put on feed were relatively\nlightweight and said feedlot operators would feed the lighter\ncattle into the autumn, rather than market them during the\nsummer as would be the case with the heavier cattle normally\nplaced on feed.\n    Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult to\nobtain, industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledge\nthat lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas.\n    The increase in lighter-weight cattle entering feedlots,\nhelps explain the jump in feedlot placements last month from\nFebruary, 1986.\n    University of Missouri Agricultural Economist Glenn Grimes\nsaid, \"The probabilities are high that in order to place that\nmany cattle on feed they (feedlot operators) had to go to\nlighter-weight cattle.\n    The only statistics available are from some terminal\nmarkets which represent only a small percentage of the total\ncattle marketed. But at those markets, steers averaged 708 lbs\nin February compared with 718 lbs last year, Grimes said.\n    Even if marketing of the lighter cattle is not delayed,\nGrimes said, beef supply likely will be reduced.\n    If the average weight is down, and there is no price\nweakness to delay marketings, the cattle would be marketed at\nlighter weights, which could reduce the beef supply as much as\nthree pct.\n    Bruce Ginn, cattle analyst for The Helming Group (formerly\nLBAS), said the lighter cattle are being placed on feed mainly\nbecause of two factors: low grain prices and higher live cattle\nprices.\n    Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grain\nsupplies are large, he noted.

Money market rates\nrecovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling\nand gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt.\n    Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and\nthe reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors\nwas set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt\nprices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates.\n    \"Today's cut was slightly disappointing,\" said Bill Martin,\nchief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. \"The\nBank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper\nthe markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget.\"\n    Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash\nto U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to\nmaintain the new rates for about that period of time.\n    The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how\nsterling performs in the near term.\n    Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially\nthrough Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains\nwould force the bank to cut interest rates rates again.\n    \"The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the\ntime being,\" said Midland Bank treasury economist David\nSimmonds. \"But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold\nup rates for long.\"\n    Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents\nthis week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday.\n    Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan\nSecurities, said \"There is another half point to come in the\nnear term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a\nwhole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks.\"\n    Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had\nvery little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange\nrate.\n    Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of\na sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not\nmaterialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact\non manufactured exports would show almost immediately.\n    Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well\nas cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances\nof re-election for the Conservative government and probably\nadvanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988.\nCombined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this\nwas likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated\nassets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial\ntargets.\n    With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour\nbecause of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase's\nMarshall said \"Sterling is simply the best game in town,\nespecially after the budget, and demand will remain strong.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"18-MAR-1987 10:53:29.43","topics":["interest","money-fx"],"places":["uk"]},"6532":{"title":"COMMERCIAL NATIONAL CORP <CNCL> CUTS QUARTERLY","body":"Commercial National Corp said\nit cut its quarterly dividend to 15 cts per share from 25 cts\ndue to current expectations for 1987 earnings.\n    The company said the dividend is payable April 10 to\nholders of record March 31.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-MAR-1987 10:54:28.53","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"6533":{"title":"TIMBERLAND INDUSTRIES INC <TIMB> 4TH QTR NET","body":"Shr 14 cts vs 22 cts\n    Net 188,000 vs 307,000\n    Sales 14.6 mln vs 12.1 mln\n    Year\n    Shr 44 cts vs 63 cts\n    Net 600,000 vs 852,000\n    Sales 51.0 mln vs 45.7 mln\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-MAR-1987 10:55:02.49","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"6534":{"title":"<MUNICIPAL FINANCIAL CORP> 1ST QTR JAN 31 NET","body":"Shr 34 cts vs 22 cts\n    Net 1,280,185 vs 875,692\n    Revs 19.0 mln vs 15.8 mln\n    Assets 585.6 mln vs 469.1 mln\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-MAR-1987 10:55:59.72","topics":["earn"],"places":["canada"]},"6535":{"title":"PAKISTAN-SWEDISH GOODS EXCHANGE AGREED","body":"Pakistan and Sweden have signed a\ncommodity exchange agreement for 88 mln dlrs each way, the\nPakistan government announced.\n    Pakistan's exports under the agreement will include raw\ncotton, cotton products, cotton textiles, steel products,\nmolasses, naphtha and fresh and dried fruits.\n    Swedish exports to Pakistan will include medical and\nlaboratory equipment, electrical telecommunication equipment,\ndiesel engine spares, mining and security equipment,\nroad-building and construction machinery, fertilisers and palm\noil.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-MAR-1987 10:57:40.04","topics":["trade","cotton","iron-steel","naphtha","veg-oil","palm-oil"],"places":["pakistan","sweden"]},"6536":{"title":"BRISTOL-MYERS TO SEEK FDA MARKETING APPROVAL FOR AIDS VIRUS BY END OF MONTH\n","date":"18-MAR-1987 10:58:06.84"},"6537":{"title":"PEAT MARWICK AND NOLAN NORTON TO MERGE","body":"<Peat Marwick>, an accounting and\nmanagement consulting firm, and <Nolan, Norton and Co>, an\ninformation and technology planning concern, said they have\nmerged.\n    The companies said with the merger Nolan now will be known\nas Nolan, Norton and Co-partners, the information technology\narm of Peat Marwick.\n    Also as part of the merger, Nolan's 21 principals have\nbecome Peat Marwick partners, the companies said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-MAR-1987 10:58:17.74","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"6538":{"title":"TRUS JOIST <TJCO> TO ACQUIRE CANADIAN FIRM","body":"Trus Joist Corp said it agreed to\npurchase Dashwood Industries Ltd, a Canadian wood window and\npatio door manufacturer, for an undisclosed amount of cash.\n    Trus Joist said it expects to close the transaction before\nJune 30.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-MAR-1987 10:59:29.49","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa","canada"]},"6539":{"title":"KINDER-CARE <KNDR> SEES HIGHER EARNINGS IN 1987","body":"Kinder-Care Inc projected its\n1987 earnings to be 44 mln dlrs.\n    Richard Grassgreen, president of the company, said earnings\nper share are expected to be between 97 cts and one dlr in\ncomparison to 75 cts earnings per share for the fiscal year\nended August 29, 1986, and 80 cts for the trailing 12 months\nended November 1986.\n    Greengrass said this represents an earnings per share\nincrease of approximately 25 to 30 pct.\n    The company said it changed its fiscal year end from August\n31 to December 31.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-MAR-1987 11:04:21.86","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"6540":{"title":"ROBBINS AND MYERS INC <ROBN> 2ND QTR FEB 28 NET","body":"Shr profit 11 cts vs loss 1.45 dlrs\n    Net profit 267,000 vs loss 3,458,000\n    Sales 23.6 mln vs 23.0 mln\n    First half\n    Shr loss 27 cts vs loss 1.91 dlrs\n    Net loss 633,000 vs loss 4,548,000\n    Sales 46.2 mln vs 49.7 mln\n    Avg shrs 2,382,000 vs 2,381,000\n    Backlog 26.1 mln vs 36.0 mln\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-MAR-1987 11:06:45.38","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"6541":{"title":"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT -

This is about half of total capacity.\n    This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most\nyards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.\n    The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for\n1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to\n3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.\n    The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to\n30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between\n1986 and 1989.\n    Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December,\nfollowed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's\nRegister of Shipping.\n    However, falling orders and declining international\ncompetitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in\nthe industry, the sources said.\n    Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding\ncompanies reported current deficits in the first half of the\nyear to March 31 and five of them are expected to report\ncurrent deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.\n    The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise\nproductivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also\nbeen hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt\nyears, the sources said.\n    In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in\nfierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity.

billion franc\ncontingency fund announced on February 25.\n    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a\nreflationary program.\n    Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for\nmore than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third\nof French unemployed, government figures show.\n    The main measures of the employment program give employers\nfinancial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at\nleast two years and stress retraining to help the long-term\nunemployed return to the labour market.\n    Training subsidies and exemptions from social security\ncontributions are the main incentives for employers.\n    \"Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong\nincentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour\nmarket and that's why the proposals...Are costly,\" an aide to\nSeguin said.\n    The analysts said speculation the government is considering\na reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman

stimulation despite the government's revision of its\n1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.\n    Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's\nremarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate\nthe economy through a boost to consumer spending although\ngovernment policy allowed for increased industrial investment\nfrom the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan.\n    The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue\nfrom privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt\nand providing state enterprises with fresh capital.\n    Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly\nreflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on\nsocial issues ahead of next year's presidential elections.\n     Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of\nstrikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and\ndrove the government into a new mood of conciliation with\nlabour.\n     Officials said that after the success of the privatisation\nof Cie de Saint Gobain <SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas\n<PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-year\nprivatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it\nthis year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in\n1988.\n    The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted\nrevenue to boost industrial and

Mitterrand, to encourage\nmore flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by\nimproving the competitiveness of French industry.\n    The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and\nvariations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put\nto parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed\nfor procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council

Today's relatively stable oil\nprices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a\nreturn to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig\ncount soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield\nroustabouts commanded premium wages.\n    The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co <HT> rig count, a\nbarometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigs\nactive in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.\n    In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but\ndived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil\nprices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.\n    Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said \"In 1986, the United\nStates replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that\nreplacement rate won't be any better this year.\"\n    He added, \"We don't have the options we do with oil.\nImports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and\nimporting liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible\nin the next 10 years because of the cost.\"\n    Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves\nwere discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16\ntrillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.\n    George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co\nagreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a\nnew cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.\n    \"We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to\ndedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990\nsupplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later\nthan mid-1988,\" Gaspar said.\n    Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that\ncould last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count\nto peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.\n    Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be\nconducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where\nfederal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the\ngovernment unless drilling begins in the next two or three\nyears. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon\nCorp <XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have\nalready indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later\nthis year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.\n    For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont <DD> subsidiary, will\nspend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest\nproduction platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of\ngas per day.\n    But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and\nKansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership <MLP> in\nrecent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is\non the verge of a recovery.\n    Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below\n600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.\n    \"The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets\nabove 30 dlrs a barrel,\" said Pickens, 58, adding he did not\nexpect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.\n    Tenneco Inc <TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,\nis skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.\n    Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect\nsignificant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s\nwhen the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about\nseven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50\ndlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three\ndlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-MAR-1987 13:23:37.68","topics":["crude","nat-gas"],"places":["usa"]},"6657":{"title":"SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT","body":"Latin American sugar producers\nare awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving\nto boost production, official and trade sources said.\n    Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S.\nCents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the\nregion's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost.\n    The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the\nalert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA),\ntold Reuters.\n    However, Rico said, it would require another five to seven\ncents to stimulate notable increases in output.\n    \"Producers are taking measures for increasing their\nproduction when the prices are profitable,\" he said.\n    Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued\nrise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders\nin Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go.\n    \"The prices are ridiculous,\" said Julian Mateo, vice\npresident of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural\nLeague. \"At current prices nobody is going to consider\nincreasing production.\"\n    Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing\noutput, given the instability of world markets.\n    An official at Colombia's National Association of Sugar\nCane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets.\n\"The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yet\ngiving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify\nanything.\"\n    In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are\navailable, Central and South American nations produced 28 mln\ntonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A\nyear earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000\nmore, according to the London-based International Sugar\nOrganization.\n    Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar\nindustry in many countries in the region into a recession from\nwhich it will be hard to recover.\n    Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic's\nNational Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost\nproduction even if prices recovered sharply.\n    Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from\n900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport\nand badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short\nterm recovery in output, he added.\n    Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugar\nexporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end\nof the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is\nrunning well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.\n    Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems\nand poor processing facilities more than from low world prices,\nsince much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries\nunder special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its\ntroubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in\n1985.\n    The low world prices of recent years have led many\ncountries in the region to cut exportable production to levels\nwhere they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean\ncountries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which\nthey receive prices well above free market levels.\n    Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to\nproduction stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to\nthe free world market.\n    Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In\nboth 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year\nits quota is only 37,000.\n    A national cooperative official said that, as long as world\nmarket levels continue at around half of Peru's production\ncost, the future of the industry is uncertain.\n    At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials\nstressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane\nwhich, according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo\nLatorre, \"grows like a weed\" throughout the region.\n    Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240\nmln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in\nexcess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into\nsugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.\n    The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol\nInstitute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from\nforeign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.\n    Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the\npast year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant\nBrazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in\n1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to\nnext year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point\nbeing how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of\nsugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would\ncost eight cents to replace.\n    Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export\nsales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with\nthe Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of\neither alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild\ndepleted reserve stockpiles.\n    However, the situation could change dramatically if the\neconomy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.\n    Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little\nhope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability\nunless the U.S. And EC change their policies.\n    \"The agricultural policies of the European Community and of\nthe United States have caused our economies incalculable harm\nby closing their markets, by price deterioration in\ninternational commerce and furthermore by the unfair\ncompetition in third countries,\" Brazil's Trade and Industry\nMinister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA\nmeeting.\n    The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for\nwhat the group charges is its continued dumping of excess\noutput on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the\nmain cause of low prices.\n    GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which\nwould regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the\nregion's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement\nwould have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised\ncountries would have to see it as a political rather than a\nmerely economic pact.\n    \"They have to realise that the more our economies suffer,\nthe less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the\nregion's 360 billion dollar foreign debt,\" GEPLACEA's Latorre\nsaid.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-MAR-1987 13:25:33.14","topics":["sugar"],"organisations":["ec"],"places":["brazil","mexico","guatemala","ecuador","panama","costa-rica","colombia","dominican-republic","usa"]},"6658":{"title":"MORGAN BANK PLANS WARRANTS FOR GOLD AT 425 DLRS","body":"Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York\nplans an issue of 12,000 warrants for gold bullion at 425 dlrs\nan ounce, lead manager Morgan Guaranty (Switzerland) AG said.\n    Each warrant, priced at 955 Swiss francs, entitled holders\nto acquire five-ounce bars of .999 gold in the period from\nApril 30, 1987, to July 31, 1991, exercisable on Wednesdays.\n    The warrants represented unsecured, unsubordinated\nliabilities of the borrower.

Just\nhow long the run is is anybody's guess,\" Swearingen said.\n    Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium\nmay force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs\nand reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first\nquarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.\n    The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these\nloans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the\nContinental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago,\nContinental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an\ninquiry.\n    Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net\nincome equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.\n    Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for\n1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses.\nContinental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing\noffice rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.\n    In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a\nshare, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.\n    The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and\nother assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC,\nduring 1986.

It will choose loans based on ultimate loss\nrather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.\n    In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market\nrose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.\n    Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank\nwould like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it\nbought three small suburban banks.\n    Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be\ntaken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large\nenough to buy it, and New York money center banks are\nprohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.\n    He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who\nwill eventually own the firm because it still holds the\nequivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.\n    The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has\nsaid it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The\nagency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984\nbailout of the bank.\n    Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the\nstruggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry\nexecutive, said he will retire when the three-year period he\nagreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not\ncomment on a successor.\n    The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options\nclearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its\ndoubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country\ndoesn't need external sources of cash.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-MAR-1987 14:08:21.35","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa","brazil"]},"6709":{"title":"RELIABLE LIFE INSURANCE CO <RLIFA> UPS DIVIDENDS","body":"Qtly div Class A 27.5 cts vs 26.4 cts prior\n    Qtly div Class B 2.5 cts vs 2.4 cts prior\n    Pay June One\n    Record May One\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"18-MAR-1987 14:08:25.37","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"6710":{"title":"CROSS AND TRECKER <CTCO> TO SELL UNIT","body":"Cross and Trecker Corp said its\nWarner and Swasey subsidiary will seek to sell its Grinding\nDivision to focus on other areas of its business.\n    The company said the Grinding Division had sales last year\nof about 18 mln dlrs.

billion dlrs, the\nchairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.\n    Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the\nuse of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are\npossibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending,\nsaid Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture\nsubcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.\n    Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and\nFeed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the\nHouse budget committee that the agriculture committee will have\nto reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion\ndlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.\n    Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be\nmade very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988\nbudget, Glickman added.\n    Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's \nproposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.\n    \"The administration's target price proposals are dead in\nthe water,\" he said.\n    To cut the budget, Glickman said, \"everthing is on the\ntable,\" except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.\n    Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee\nwill study in order to cut farm spending.\n    Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and\n1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he\nsaid would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.\n    Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or \"pik')\ncertificates will also be another option his committee will\nstudy, Glickman said.\n    While not committing himself for or against such action, he\nsaid lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which\nindicate certificates cost more than cash payments.\n    Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and\ntightening up of the person definition for annual payment\nlimitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.\n    He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by\nfive pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move\nthat could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would\nnot be in

according to testimony\ngiven to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of\nthe industry hearing today.\n     The Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas\nindustry, heard testimony from a number of high-level company\nexecutives reflecting a belief that the recent industry\ndownturn had bottomed out.\n     \"The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal\nmore optimistic (than last year),\" Commissioner James E. (Jim)\nNugent told Reuters.\n     \"It reflects their (the executives) belief that they are\nseeing the bottom of the economic cycle,\" he added, \"and with\njust a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move\nagain.\"\n     The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil\nprices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to\nas low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to\naround 18 dlrs a barrel.\n     At the same time, a number of company executives testified\nthat the nation's domestic exploration and production segment\nwas still hurting and in need of government help.\n     Production costs are considerably higher in the United\nStates than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell\nmany domestic producers were forced to shut down their\noperations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs\noperating in the United States compared with an average of\nnearly 2,000 in 1985.\n     Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of\nEnergy, many said the falling production of domestic oil\ncoupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing\ndependency on imports, particularly from the politically\nvolatile Middle East.\n     \"In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower\nprices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day\n(bpd),\" said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply\nDepartment at Exxon Corp <XON>, the nation's largest oil\ncompany.\n     At the same time, Simon said \"U.S. oil production declined\nby 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years,\" and \"net\npetroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd.\"\n     Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain\nbetween 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC's ability to\ncontrol production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at\n1986 levels, leading to \"a significant amount of spare\nworldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd.\"\n     He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued\nvolatility and called for \"governmental and regulatory policies\nin support of the domestic petroleum industry.\"\n     Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal\ngovernment through the 1986 tax code changes and \"Superfund\"\nlegislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall\nprofits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access\nto federal lands for oil and gas exploration.\n     Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the\nindustry have called for as a way of building up the nation's\ndomestic operations before imports reach such a level that\nnational security might be compromised.\n     In yesterday's report, the Energy Department said imports\ncould make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that\nPersian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the\nfree world's total oil consumption by that date.\n     Arguing that \"oil is a political tool in every nation on\nearth,\" Frank Pitts, chairman of <Pitts Oil Co>, today called\nfor a variable oil import fee, among other measures, \"before\nthe treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and\nour national security is compromised.\"\n     Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co,\nagreed, saying that like many federal government programs that\nwere set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a\n\"shambles.\"\n     Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future.\n\"For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is\nover,\" he said.\n     Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining\nand Marketing Co, said he was \"enthusiastic about the future,\"\nadding that he expected \"an increase in profitability by\nmidyear.\"\n

John Dingell (D-Mi.), chairman of the House\nEnergy and Commerce Committee and head of a subcommittee\nresponsible for overseeing the SEC.\n    Dingell has promised to look into program trading and\nexplore ways of insuring investors and hedgers against market\ndisruptions. He is interested in reviewing margins and dual\ntrading, a practice that allows futures brokers to trade for\ntheir own account before placing customers' orders.\n    Recently, a group of CME members, concerned over the\nperception of abuse of dual trading, proposed banning the\npractice. The CME board responded with a plan that would\nrestrict, but not ban, the activity.\n    The meeting will also be attended by regulators from\nAustralia, Britain, France, Hong Kong, New Zealand and\nSingapore. Their appearance coincides with a controversial CFTC\nproposal to adopt new regulations over the trading of foreign\nfutures and options on U.S. exchanges.\n    The U.S. exchanges oppose the proposed regulations on the\ngrounds they would prove unnecessarily burdensome.\n    Other areas of disagreement between the CFTC and the\nexchanges include the requirement that the exchanges implement\nstrict, one-minute audit trails by this summer, proposals to\nrevise federal limits on speculative positions and the\ndefinition of hedging, and CFTC efforts to determine which

Baker said yesterday\nthe concept of debt relief was misguided. \"If we write it all\noff and declare defeat, these countries will decay and wither\non the vine,\" the Treasury Secretary said of an end to capital\ninflows that would follow debt relief.\n    Baker has said his own plan was broad and would embrace new\ninnovative ideas bringing together debtors and creditors.\n    Baker and Volcker launched their in late 1985, calling on\ncommercial and multilateral banks to increase loans to major\ndebtors pursuing inflation-free expansion and open markets.\n    \"They sat down together to discuss the implications for\nLatin America and feel each other out on the best way out,\" a\nWright aide said of the meeting. Other sources said they expect\nthe dialogue to continue.\n    The talks come after Brazil's interest rate moratorium and\nan uncompromising stand by the country's finance minister,\nDilson Funaro, after talks with western leaders.\n    Some U.S. officials feel Funaro's consolidation of power\nover the Brazilian economy with the ouster of Planning minister\nJoao Sayad is further reason to worry.\n    Another proposal, to allow regulators to grant commercial\nbanks more flexibility in accounting for Third World loans, has\nbeen presented by Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat,\nbut did not come up yesterday.\n    Wright, who has not hitherto concerned himself with debt,\n\"is concerned about the potential for damage.

The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature.\n    The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that\nsaid the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be\nconsummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate\nbanking outside of New England come down. \"If we can consummate\nthe deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,\"\nLougee said.

Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp.\n    If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said,\nan option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase\nprovisions.\n    The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New\nYork as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled\nup by the money center giants.\n    Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet\nand Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of\ninterstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain\npermitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S.\nSupreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers.\n    Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed\nmerger as \"a partnership of two companies.\" Both will continue\nto operate existing headquarters after the merger.\n    Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one\nof theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one\nsplit.

He said Norstar had a book value at\nthe end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's book\nvalue was 28.02 dlrs.\n    Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his\n60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said\nKiernan would probably head the combined company until his\nretirement then Murray could assume the top post.\n    Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said\nFleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986\non the basis of the merger terms announced today.\n    He noted that Fleet has a \"teriffic reputation\" after\nhaving diversified in a number of financial areas.
