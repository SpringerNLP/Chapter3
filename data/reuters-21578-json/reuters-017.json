It is\ntaking on new prominence because of current trade woes.\n    That is because the budget problems and its associated huge\ndeficits are said to be at the root of related international\ntrade friction currently worrying financiers.\n    As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stock\nexchanges gyrate wildly, the trade dispute involving the United\nStates and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major trade\nwar between the two trading giants for the first time since\nWorld War II.\n    Ostensibly that dispute is over U.S. charges that Japan is\nrefusing to open its markets to semi-conductor chips and the\nresulting U.S. tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisions\nand small computers.\n    Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neither\nside wants, is the dilemma of the U.S. budget and its deficit.\n    Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up to\nthe economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue to\ngrow without repercussions.\n    A large portion of the U.S. debt has been financed by\nforeigners from their accumulated trade surpluses. But if they\nwithdraw this support the result can only be further problems,\nincluding higher interest rates for Americans.\n    In a nutshell, the U.S. budget process has now moved to the\nshowdown stages in Congress. Reagan's own trillion dollar\nspending budget for the government year 1988, starting Oct. 1,\nwas trounced badly in the House on April 9.\n    The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed the\nHouse, calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated 171\nbillion dlr level next year to about 134 billion dlrs, through\ndefense and domestic spending cuts and about 18.5 billion dlrs\nin new, unspecified, taxes. As the Senate prepares to take up\nits own budget plan, majority Democrats predict there will be\npassage of a bill, only after a protracted partisan battle.\n    In the House, not one Republican voted for the budget,\nwhich passed by 230 to 192. In the Senate, none of Reagan's\nRepublicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the Senate\nBudget Committee for full Senate consideration.\n    A key Senate Budget Committee source told Reuters he\nbelieves this very unusual unanimous opposition was by design\namong congressional Republicans, perhaps with the tacit\napproval of the White House.\n    \"Republicans want Democrats to take the heat for any tax\nhikes and defense cuts,\" he said.\n    In the coming weeks, the source said, Democrats will press\nfor a bipartisan budget and seek a negotiated budget with\nReagan -- who already is opposed to the idea. But \"it is not\nclear how the Republicans will act,\" he added.\n    He said Republicans may propose their own plan for lower\ntaxes and more defense spending, which they did not offer after\nReagan's budget was clobbered in an early vote in the House.\n     When Reagan entered the White House in 1981, he inherited\nwhat was labelled a huge deficit from Jimmy Carter that wound\nup to be nearly 79 billion dlrs that year.\n    Despite Reagan's promise to balance the budget by 1983,\ncritics note that his administration's record of accumulated\ndebt is estimated over one trillion dlrs, or 1,100 billion\ndlrs.\n    That is money the government must borrow, and pay back, and\nmany analysts say it is what kept the dollar high and caused\nthe worst U.S. trade deficit ever.\n     Last year the United States bought goods from the world\nworth 169.8 billion dlrs more than what it sold, including\npurchases of 58.6 billion dlrs in Japanese goods.\n    While Congress is trying to attack the trade deficit on one\nfront through a get-tough trade bill promising retaliatory\nmeasures unless all markets are opened, its success so far\nagainst the budget deficit has been marked by limited progress.\n    Congress, which controls the pursestrings, has put the\ndeficit on a downward path from its record high of 220.7\nbillion dlrs accumulated in fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30.\n    Because of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law\nenacted in late 1985, there has been pressure on Congress to do\nmore than talk about deficits.\n    That law, named after Republican Senators Phil Gramm of\nTexas, Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Democrat Ernest\nHollings of South Carolina, calls for a balanced budget by 1991\nthrough a series of set deficit targets that Congress must meet.\n    The law has been followed, even though an enforcement\nmechanism to mandate automatic across-the-board cuts if\nCongress misses its goal was stricken by the Supreme Court.\n    The legislators have followed the targets -- on paper. But\nin reality, the goal has actually been missed. For example,\nCongress last year approved legislation to meet the 1987 target\nof a 144 billion dlr deficit. But even after approving the\nnumbers, the deficit for 1987 is estimated at over 170 billion\ndlrs -- far off the target.\n    This year the target is 108 billion dlrs and that goal is\nexpected to be missed widely.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"21-APR-1987 12:39:55.30","topics":["trade"],"places":["usa"]},"17024":{"title":"COMMONWEALTH EDISON <CWE> SELLS MORTGAGE BONDS","body":"Commonwealth Edison Co is raising 360\nmln dlrs via a two-tranche offering of first and refunding\nmortgage bonds, said lead manager Morgan Stanley and Co Inc.\n    A 200 mln dlr issue of bonds due 1990 has an 8-1/8 pct\ncoupon and was priced at 99.775 to yield 8.21 pct, or 65 basis\npoints over comparable Treasury securities.\n    A 160 mln dlr offering of bonds due 1992 has an 8-5/8 pct\ncoupon and was priced at 99.85 to yield 8.661 pct, or 78 basis\npoints more than Treasuries.

Discount\nwindow borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate\naverage and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent\nwith a modest tightening,\" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago\nCorp.\n    Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that\nthe Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.\n    Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were\n935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week\nstatement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of\nDecember 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.\n    Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion\ndlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this\nyear - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the\nFed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in\nreserves than the Fed had anticipated.\n    However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed\nis aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than\nwitnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have\nforced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.\n    First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week\nended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,\npartly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the\nproceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to\npay annual income taxes.\n    As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the\nreserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.\n    Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion\ndlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists\nsaid the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the\nprojected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to\nadd reserves too late.\n    Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently\nleft Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which\nto enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists\nsaid. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos\noutstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add\neven more reserves but was prevented from doing so.\n    \"It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as\nmuch as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,\"\nsaid Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.\n    McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting\ndiscount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,\nequivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.\n    After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not\ntightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,\neconomists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging \novernight injections of reserves until the last day of the\nstatement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.\n    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that\nthe Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's\nfigures, he said, \"It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving\ntoward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.\"\n    Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8\npct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate\nunless the dollar's fall gathers pace.\n    Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political\nopposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time\nwhen Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to\nreducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"23-APR-1987 19:02:27.01","topics":["money-supply"],"places":["usa"]},"17037":{"title":"RORER GROUP INC <ROR> 1ST QTR NET","body":"Oper shr profit 34 cts vs loss 78 cts\n    Oper net profit 7,434,000 vs loss 17.0 mln\n    Revs 201.2 mln vs 171.7 mln\n    Note: Year-ago oper exludes gain on sale of businesses of\n139.6 mln.\n    Year-ago oper includes charges of 27.8 mln resulting from\nallocation of the purchase price of Revlon's businesses to\ninventory and 7.1 mln for restructuring costs.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"23-APR-1987 19:08:09.42","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"17038":{"title":"MILD COFFEE GROWERS TO MEET IN GUATEMALA","body":"A large group of \"other milds\"\ncoffee-growing nations will hold talks in Guatemala next month\nto map their strategy for next September's meeting of the\nInternational Coffee Organisation (ICO).\n    Mario Fernandez, executive director of the Costa Rican\ncoffee institute, said delegates from Mexico, the Dominican\nRepublic, Peru, Ecuador, India, Papua New Guinea and five\ncentral american nations will participate in the two-day\nstrategy session beginning May 4.\n    The main topic will be reform of what many producing\ncountries perceive as the ICO's unfair distribution of export\nquotas, Fernandez said.\n    He said Costa Rica would press for quotas \"based on the\nreal production and export potential of each country in the\npast few years\" and to distribute quotas based on \"historic\"\nproduction levels rather than recent harvests and crop\nestimates.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"23-APR-1987 19:36:56.77","topics":["coffee"],"organisations":["ico-coffee"],"places":["costa-rica","guatemala"]},"17039":{"title":"US STUDY DISCUSSES DROPPED COMSAT-CONTEL MERGER","body":"A congressional study today said the\nproposed, but now apparently abandoned, merger of the\nCommunications Satellite Corp <CQ> and Contel Corp <CTC>\nwould technically be legal but could violate the spirt of the\nlaw setting up COMSAT.\n    Two weeks ago before the study was completed, Contel\nannounced it would seek to terminate the proposed merger.\n    The study by the non partisan Congressional Research\nService (CRS) said \"the proposed merger appears to comply,\ntechnically, with the mandates or letter of statutes, if may\nnevertheless violate the spirit of the law.\"\n    Comsat, created by a 1962 act of Congress, and Contel, a\ncorporation of local telephone and communications firms, filed\nwith the Federal Communications Commission last November 3 an\napplication for merger.

GDP rose about 1.7 pct in 1986 compared with\n2.2 pct in 1985. But this growth depended largely on external\nfactors, particularly lower oil prices, the OECD secretariat\nsaid in its latest annual report on Sweden.\n    It warned that labour costs had risen more rapidly in\nSweden than in other OECD countries.\n    Because of high labour costs Swedish industry, which\nlargely relies upon export markets, was losing market share.\nWages in the manufacturing sector grew by seven pct in 1986, in\nline with 1985 increases, while public sector wages rose an\nestimated 9.2 pct in 1986, up from six pct in 1985.\n    This was significantly higher than average wage increases\nof 3.75 pct for the seven largest members of the OECD in 1986.\n    The report said wage moderation was central to maintaining\neconomic growth in Sweden.

she told\nreporters at a briefing following informal talks with the U.S.,\nJapanese and European Community (EC) trade ministers here.\n    Canada, strongly supported by Australia, has championed the\ncause of both developed and developing nations which have seen\ntheir farm trade suffer largely due to a farm subsidy war\nbetween the United States and the EC.\n    Japan\"s protected agricultural markets have also attracted\ncriticism.\n    The issue is of extreme importance to many indebted,\ndeveloping nations which often rely totally on one or two farm\nsector exports to sustain their economies but which cannot\ncompete with the subsidised U.S. And EC products.\n    \"Canada can afford so many billions of dollars (to do so),\nbut many countries cannot,\" said Carney.\n    She said the EC had changed its previous unhelpful attitude\nand had raised proposals similar to those of Canada under which\nto discuss the issue.\n    Talks will now continue at the

affected.\n    Canada\"s five point programme demands that farm product\nprices must reflect open world market prices, that any support\nfor farmers incomes should not be linked to production\nincentives, that there should be no new farm subsidies, no new\nfarm import barriers, and that any decisions should be\nimplemented collectively.\n    The farm trade problem was almost completely ignored by the\nindustrialised world until Canada raised it last year at the\nTokyo summit of seven leading industrial powers.\n    The distortions created by subsidies and protectionism have\ncreated some absurd situations.\n    For example, to protect its farmers the Japanese government\nbuys Canadian wheat and sells it at 10 times the purchase price\nto Japanese consumers.\n    \"So we end up borrowing in the Japanese (financial) market\nto help pay subsidies to keep our farmers while they make a\nprofit on our wheat to help pay the price support for their\nfarmers,\" said

profits in the Gulf oil state of\nQatar are coming under renewed pressure and foreign banks are\nretrenching further in one of the region\"s most overbanked\nmarkets.\n    Results for 1986 show a year of declining profit for\nseveral foreign banks, although locally-owned operations were\nin some cases able to cushion the drop by increasing market\nshare.\n    <Qatar National Bank SAQ>\"s (QNB) General Manager, Abdulla\nKhalid al-Attiya, said: \"The economy is not improving as we\nhoped... 1987 will be another difficult year for the banks.\"\n    Oil-dependent Qatar, with a tiny indigenous population of\n60,000 to 80,000 and an expatriate workforce estimated at about\n280,000, boasts five local banks and 10 foreign bank\noperations.\n    Local and foreign bankers in the capital said the Gulf-wide\nrecession, aggravated this year by Qatar\"s severe difficulty\nmarketing its crude oil at official OPEC prices, has taken a\nheavy toll on the economy and bank profitability.\n    As a result, the only U.S. Bank, <Citibank NA>, is thought\nto be negotiating to sell its operation to the fast growing\nlocally based <Al Ahli Bank of Qatar QSC> which only started\noperations in 1984, bankers said. Citibank would not comment.\n    Other foreign banks have retrenched, with <Standard\nChartered Bank> cutting staff and others expected to follow.\n<Banque Paribas> is examining a change in its status to admit\n51 pct Qatari ownership in a bid to improve its access to local\nbusiness, bankers said.\n    One banker added: \"Weak profits are here to stay for the\ntime being. There is no cause for optimism at the moment.\"\n    Sentiment had picked up briefly at the end of last year\nwhen OPEC reached its accord to curb oil output and return to\nfixed prices. However, it soon became apparent that Qatar was\nhaving difficulty selling oil at OPEC prices.\n    The soft spot oil market has left official Qatari crude\nprices 20 to 40 cents more expensive and sales have been\nrunning in recent weeks at 100,000 and 120,000 barrels per day,\nwell down on the nation\"s OPEC quota of 285,000, oil sources\nsaid.\n    Bankers said this serious shortfall in Qatar\"s revenue has\nled to a new spate of payments delays from the public sector to\nprivate contractors after a marginal improvement in January.\n    Loan loss provisions continued to eat into bank profits\nlast year, as did the introduction of minimum reserve\nrequirements by the Qatar Monetary Agency. Trade financing has\nalmost dried up as a traditional source of bank income.\n    Of the local banks, QNB conducts the bulk of the\ngovernment\"s business and subsequently enjoys a huge advantage\nits rivals cannot expect to match, bankers said.\n    The bank reported a 2.9 pct rise in net 1986 profit to 93.1\nmln Qatari riyals, while its balance sheet grew by 10.8 pct to\n9.0 billion, making it by far the largest bank in Qatar.\n    But the strong assets growth partly reflected bridging\nloans for the public and private sector to tide government\ndepartments and local business over the lean economic spell,\nAttiya said. \"Generally speaking, we are overbanked in Qatar,\" he\nsaid, echoing a widespread feeling in the banking community.\n    Other local banks fared less strongly. The second largest,\n<Doha Bank Ltd QSC>, reported a 13 pct drop in net profit to\n27.5 mln riyals, while <Commercial Bank of Qatar Ltd QSC>,\nregistered a decline to 18.5 mln riyals from 19.4 mln in 1985.\n    The newcomer Al Ahli Bank, continued to expand rapidly and\nreported net profit of 5.2 mln compared with 3.3 mln during the\nstart-up period from August 4, 1984 to end-1985.\n    Bankers said the local banks had clearly begun to win\ncommercial deposits previously held by foreign banks,\nincreasing already strong pressure on non-Qatari banks to\nreexamine their staffing levels and overheads.\n    <Grindlays Bank PLC> recorded a net loss at its Doha branch\nlast year of 4.7 mln riyals after registering a nominal profit\nin 1985 of 12,000 riyals.\n    Two other long-established banks in the Gulf, the <British\nBank of the Middle East> (BBME) and Standard Chartered, also\nfound last year a difficult climate to make strong profits.\n    BBME\"s net profit fell to 3.2 mln riyals from 10.4 mln in\n1985, but Assistant Manager John Farquharson said 1985\"s result\nhad been artificially inflated by tax rebates on provisions.\n    \"Foreign banks are seeing their assets decline, while local\nbanks are increasing their market share,\" Farquharson said.\n    BBME\"s operating profit was steady in 1986, edging up to\n12.3 mln riyals from 11.5 mln in 1985. \"We are expecting the\nsame level of operating profit in 1987,\" Farquharson said.\n    Standard Chartered\"s net profit last year recovered slightly\nto 1.6 mln riyals after a loss of 161,000 in 1985.

But analysts say the bullish trend probably will not\nlast. Tight restrictions on foreign ownership of shares have\nheld back development on the market, they say. While some of\nthese rules could soon be eased, Norway's unresolved economic\nwoes mean the prices boom is likely to be short-lived.\n    Last Thursday, the all-share index reached 325.48 points to\nbeat the previous record of 325.31 set in mid-November, 1985.\n    Brokers say the new record, spurred by firmer oil prices\nabove 18 dlrs a barrel which are crucial to Norway's economy,\nhas for now set the Oslo bourse apart from the current\nfluctuations on other world stock markets.\n    \"It's an underdeveloped market...Virgin territory ,\" Jenny\nTora, a Scandinavian securities analyst with London-based\nstockbrokers James Capel, told Reuters.\n    But the attraction for foreign investors of the stock\nmarket, where price/earnings ratios average around a relatively\nlow 11, is tempered by restrictions and some nervousness about\nthe future of Norway's economy, analysts say.\n    Foreign ownerhsip is limited in all sectors and varies\nbetween 10 and 40 pct of the shares of any company - and the\nclass of shares rarely carry voting rights.\n    \"It's often hard to get stocks as the quotas are full,\" Tora\nsaid. \"There can be problems of liquidity in the market.

The current account balance of payments\ndeficit stood at 32.8 billion crowns last year, against a\nsurplus of 26.8 billion crowns in 1985.\n    \"I'd be very cautious about present stock levels,\" Chris\nHonnor of London-based brokers Grieveson Grant said.\n    The record-breaking performance last Thursday meant that\nthe all-share index had increased by 16 pct from the start of\n1987.\n    On Friday the index leapt another 7.78 points to 333.26.\nBut analysts noted this was largely due to much better than\nexpected profits in the first quarter from Norsk Hydro,\nNorway's largest diversified corporation.\n    Foreign investors, spurred by the appreciating crown and\nthe rise in oil prices, have been more prominent in the market\nthis year, although they still trade selectively mainly in\nNorsk Hydro, Norsk Data and a few other top-traded industrials.\n    Earlier this month the government proposed allowing the\nshare of foreign ownerhsip permitted in financial institutions\nto rise in a bid to boost competition.

Japan has\nbeen given plenty of time to reform its agricultural support\nsystem and the quotas must be scrapped, Lyng said.\n    Japanese officials want to begin informal talks on beef and\ncitrus in August or September in Hawaii, sources said.\n    If the U.S. intends to press its tough stance, and Japan,\nas expected rejects the demands, the issue may then be put to\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for settlement,\nwhich would mean prolonging the friction beyond the April, 1988\ndeadline set by the U.S., officials said.\n    In interviews here, Japanese officials insist that on beef\nthey will not liberalize imports, regardless of the U.S.\npressure, because the Japanese beef industry is not competitive\nand would be damaged by freer trade.\n    Most Japanese beef production still tends to be on small\nfarms which Japanese officials said must be protected from\ncheap imports by use of the quota system.\n    Furthermore, while the U.S. National Cattlemen's\nAssociation is strongly supporting the tough administration\nposition, some U.S. meat exporters and packers are ambivalent.\n    This is because to some U.S. exporters and packers beef\nexports to Japan under the quota system are a steady, reliable\nbusiness managed by a quasi-government Japan Livestock Industry\nPromotion Corporation. Under quotas the U.S. share of Japan's\nbeef market has expanded at the expense of Australia.\n    In the absence of quotas, some U.S. suppliers are concerned\nthe U.S. share might decline and exporting to Japan would\nbecome a riskier business, meat industry sources said.\n    Major U.S meat industry leaders will meet in Washington\nnext week, including cattlemen, processors and exporters, in an\neffort to reach an industry-wide consensus toward Japan.\n    The citrus industry also appears split on the quota issue.\nCalifornia's Sunkist, the largest U.S. supplier of oranges to\nJapan, has expressed reservations about eliminating quotas.\n    A representative of Sunkist said the cooperative is\nconcerned that in the absence of quotas, lower quality oranges\nfrom Israel and South Africa might be competitive in Japan.\n    Ironically, some Japanese officials hinted that fresh\noranges may be a product on which imports could be freed with a\nminimum of impact on Japanese mandarin orange production.\n    This is because U.S. oranges do not directly compete with\nsmaller Japanese mandarins, officials said.

That\nshould not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however,\nthey said.\n    The Bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interest\nrate tenders, following the introduction of a new system to\nspeed up the tender process at the start of April, they said.\n    Reinhard Pohl, head of the monetary policy section at the\nDIW economic research institute in West Berlin, said the\nBundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts.\n    \"I don't think that if they cut the repurchase rate a little\nit would stop a wave of (currency) speculation,\" he said. But a\nsharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force the\nBundesbank to take some action, he said.\n    Pohl said the Bundesbank was concerned that a cut in\ninterest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth.\n    Some Bundesbank officials have argued recently that the\nmonetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows rather\nthan credit growth, and therefore a more appropriate response\nto excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates, to make\nthe mark and mark investments less attractive.\n    Pohl said the Bundesbank was hoping that domestic investors\nwould switch funds parked in liquid short-term accounts, which\nhave swollen central bank money stock, into securities, which\nwould take them out of the Bundesbank's key monetary measure.\n    A cut in interest rates at this stage however would lead\ninvestors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the next\nmove would be upwards. They would therefore hold off buying\nbonds, leaving central bank money stock swollen.\n    There are so far no signs that German investors are\nswitching funds into long term securities as the Bundesbank\nhopes they will, Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank\neconomist Hermann Remsperger said.\n    But Phillips and Drew's Reid said prospects of lower rates\nand a strong currency would attract foreign investors into\nGerman bonds, which would in turn attract domestic investors.\n    Werner Rein, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerland\nin Zurich, said he thought it likely that interest rates would\ncontinue to drift lower in many European countries.\n    \"The scope for lower rates is probably greatest in Britain\nbut more limited in West Germany, where we could see some\nconsolidation,\" he said. Switzerland could be forced to match\nany cut in German rates to prevent the franc rising further\nagainst the mark, he said.\n    Currency dealers in London said another half-point cut in\nU.K. Bank base rates was likely in the next few weeks as the\npound had shrugged off yesterday's cuts and was still rising.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"29-APR-1987 11:05:19.31","topics":["money-fx","dmk","interest"],"places":["west-germany"]},"17397":{"title":"SWISS PREPARED TO INCREASE CURRENCY INTERVENTION","body":"The Swiss National Bank is\nprepared to increase its intervention on currency markets if\nthe action can be properly coordinated with other central\nbanks, Markus Lusser, a member of the Bank's three man\ndirectorate, said.\n    He told a meeting of Swiss industrialists that intervention\nto support the dollar could not bring about lasting changes in\nexchange rates unless accompanied by fundamental changes in\neconomic policy.\n    However, intervention could send signals that would\ncontribute to a short term smoothing of currency movements.\n    The National Bank was prepared to intensify cooperation\nwith other central banks, especially where convincing\ncoordination and significant timing are guaranteed, Lusser\nsaid.\n    He said currency developments could not simply be talked\ninto existence but needed to be matched by actions in the field\nof economic policy.\n    \"Put simply, that means that in order to stabilise the\ndollar in a lasting way, a reduction of the budget deficit and\na slowdown in money supply growth in the United States are\nunavoidable,\" he said.\n    The National Bank has intervened in dollar-yen repeatedly\nin the last few weeks and earlier this week it said it had\nintervened in dollar-Swiss franc for the first time since last\nOctober.\n    Lusser said the key to increased exchange rate stability\nlay not in currency intervention by central banks but only in\nan improvement in international economic policy coordination.\n    This meant that industrial countries must avoid abrupt\nswitches in economic policy and give priority to price\nstability.\n    Lusser said the National Bank continued to take the view\nthat easing its strict monetary policies would be incompatible\nwith its primary goal of combatting inflation.

Heavy crude oil resources\ninclude extra-heavy oil/tar sand, natural bituminous sands and\noil shales (in sedimentary rock).\n     Willmon cited major factors that will make heavy oil\ndevelopment economical, including real and stable growth in\ncrude oil prices, favorable fiscal terms, and improved\ntechnology.\n    He said he expects \"all pieces of the puzzle to fit\ntogether.\" But he cautioned that the short-term outlook is very\nsensitive to crude oil prices.

At the same time, most were supportive of Hodel.\n     Environmental concerns, particularly in California, had\nlobbied strenuously against offshore oil development.\n     \"The (Outer Continental Shelf) leasing program fails to\ntake into account the environmental performance of the oil\nindustry,\" said Bill Bradford, executive vice president of\nDresser Industries <DI> and president of the Petroleum\nEquipment Suppliers Association.\n     Huff quoted National Academy of Science figures showing\noffshore rigs contributed only two pct of petroleum pollution\nin the oceans, while tankers were responsible for 47 pct and\nmuniciple dumping 31 pct.\n     \"The OCS is the keystone of the domestic reserve\ndevelopment program,\" said Siess, adding that with oil imports\nrising to 50 pct of U.S. oil consumption, the issue was one of\nnational security.\n     Looking ahead, Constantine S. Nicandros, president of\nDupont's <DD> Conoco Inc subsidiary, said, \"We are more likely\nto see a five pct increase in spending this year than the\nwidely-forecast five pct decrease.\"\n     Other optimistic signs include the recent sale in New\nOrleans of offshore tracts in the Gulf of Mexico which raised\n290 mln dlrs against an expected 90 mln.\n     However, Ronald Tappmeyer, vice chairman of Reading and\nBates Drilling Co <RB>, said the oversupply of rigs would\ncontinue for the near-term, but added demand for\ntechnologically advanced rigs would increase in the 1990s.\n     Much of that demand is seen coming from the move into\nicreasingly deeper waters, with the projects becoming ever more\nexpensive and needing five to ten years to develop.\n     Over 50 pct of the sales in New Orleans were for deep\nwater tracts.\n     Ronald L. Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co, a\nsubsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell <RD>, and president of the\nMarine Technology Society, said the technology existed to drill\nexploratory wells in up to 10,000 feet of water.\n     Geer said the industry was particularly interested in the\nGreen Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number of\ncompanies, including Shell, Conoco, USX Corp's Marathon Oil Co,\nStandard Oil Co <SRD> and Placid Oil Co, are working, many of\nthem testing new deep-water technologies involving floating\nplatforms.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"29-APR-1987 19:22:52.24","topics":["crude"],"places":["usa"]},"17434":{"title":"VENEZUELA APPROVES WAGE INCREASES, PRICE CONTROLS","body":"Venezuelan president Jaime Lusinchi\napproved a general wage increase in the form of bonuses ranging\nfrom 20 to 30 pct and a 120-day price freeze on a basket of\nbasic consumer goods.\n    Both measures, which take effect on May 1, were approved by\nthe cabinet.

The latter was proposed in\na letter this week from Cartagena to G-7 leaders who are due to\nattend a summit in Venice this month.\n    Another idea is to include debt under Gatt negotiations,\nbut Cartegena ministers have yet to endorse any proposals.\n    Speaking earlier in New York, Uruguay's Foreign Minister\nand Cartagena group chairman Enrique Iglesias said Citicorp's\ndecision could discourage new lending. But it might help\nCartagena's bid to have old and new debt treated separately.\n    The Cartagena group, which has not met at ministerial level\nfor over a year, wants to repay debt contracted before the debt\ncrisis at the low interest rates prevailing in the 1970s.

It was\ncalled to review developments since the last ministerial\nmeeting in February 1986 and to think up new ideas.\n    Since the last ministerial meeting there have been some\nadvances, such as Mexico's growth-oriented 77 billion dlr loan\nand refinancing package agreed last September.

Only Venezuela is paying back\nprincipal. Most countries have no prospect of paying their\ndebts in the foreseeable future.\n    Citicorp has made clear its decision to move three billion\ndlrs to reserves does not mean it is writing-off the loans.\n    Latin American officials here said Citicorp's move would\nprobably boost trading of discounted third world debt in the\nsecondary market, implicitly downvaluing the amount owed. But\nthey said it might make new lending even more remote.\n    Discounted debt can be bought by foreign investors through\ndebt-equity schemes that generate new resources for debtor\neconomies. Chile and Mexico are currently front-runners in this\nfield, but most Latin American officials see these schemes as\nlimited and no panacea for the overall problem.\n    Most Latin officials set greater store on building up\nexport income than on debt-equity schemes.\n    Exports hit 97.7 billion dlrs in 1984, cutting the region's\ndebt service ratio to 36 pct, but they fell to 78.3 billion\nlast year.

H.C.F. Porsche AG <PSHG.F>\nto continue its slide because of the weak U.S. Dollar.\n    They were generally optimistic for Bayerische Motoren Werke\nAG <BMWG.F> (BMW) but some were sceptical it could match record\n1986 profits. Views were mixed on Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, but\nsome analysts took comfort from the fact that Europe's leading\ncar maker had apparently put a major currency scandal behind\nit.\n    VW could be vulnerable as Japanese exporters, suffering\nfrom the strength of the yen against the dollar, switched their\nsales offensive from the U.S. To Europe, they said.\n    Analyst Joseph Rooney with brokers James Capel in London,\nnoted the Japanese drive was coming at a time when the whole\nEuropean market was expected to contract slightly.\n    But analysts saw most German manufacturers meeting the\nchallenge, even though the Japanese were now starting to focus\non the up-market sector.\n    BMW's chairman Eberhard von Kuenheim shrugged off the\nJapanese drive in an interview with Wirtschaftswoche magazine.\"I\nview the move by the Japanese into the top class with a certain\nequanimity. Not only are we playing on home turf, we also have\ntechnical superiority,\" he said.\n    The car industry benefitted last year from clarification of\ndomestic rules on low-pollution cars, which meant orders put\noff in 1985 were carried out the following year. Tax cuts\ngenerally boosted domestic demand, especially for cars.\n    Domestic registrations leapt by nearly 19 pct to a record\n2.8 mln cars. The VDA industry association says this might ease\nto 2.7 mln in 1987, but predicts another good year.\n    Looking to the future, Daimler has designated 16 billion\nmarks for car sector spending in the next five years. Chairman\nWerner Breitschwerdt says spending is not aimed at quantity but\nimproving high quality technology and accessories.\n    Analyst Stephen Reitman with Phillips and Drew in London,\nsaid Daimler had the best earnings profile of West German\nproducers, with group profits per share rising to 80 marks from\n78.8 in 1986.\n    Analysts were more cautious about VW. Reinhard Fischer with\nBank in Liechtenstein (BiL) in Frankfurt saw VW's group\nearnings per share falling to 35 marks in 1987 from 42 in 1986.\nA recent report from his bank said last year's currency losses\nwere a sign of mismanagement.\n    It stressed heavy losses from VW's Brazilian operations and\nits Spanish unit, SEAT.\n    VW's first quarter figures also highlighted problems in\nboth the U.S. And Brazil, analysts said.\n    VW reported flat first quarter earnings, except for a 39.2\npct fall in U.S. Sales and Brazilian sales which dived 46.5\npct.\n    Reitman was more optimistic than BiL about VW's 1987 group\nearnings and, predicting an improvement in both Spain and\nBrazil, he saw an unchanged 42 marks per share, ,\n    He also said that VW now stood to benefit from not hedging\nagainst foreign exchange fluctuations.\n    In a May 1 study, he wrote: \"One point in VW's favour is\nthat its extraordinary policy of not hedging forward has meant\nthat it will have less far to go in adjusting to current\nDM/Dollar rates than the other German manufacturers who were to\na lesser or greater extent protected up to 1986.\"\n    Reitman was also reassured by the apparent end of the\ncurrency scandal, where allegedly faked forward contracts were\nnot acknowledged by VW's banks. VW fixed final losses from the\nfraud at 473 mln marks for which provisions were made in 1986.\n    VW's new Audi 80, a sporty model which German media reports\nsay was designed to jazz up Audi's staid \"Grandpa\" image,\ncontributed significantly to VW's first quarter performance.\nThe 80 doubled its sales against the year-ago level.\n    But the Audi range as a whole has suffered a huge setback\nin the U.S. Because of an image problem linked to claims of\n\"unintentional acceleration.\"\n    Von Kuenheim won't be pinned down on BMW's 1987 profits,\nbut at a news conference he emphasised 1986 earnings were a\nrecord high. Without referring to 1987, he added: \"If profits\nare less in one year or the other they will still be good.\"\n    Rooney said group profits per share, which BMW does not\npublish, would rise to 62.5 marks this year. Some analysts put\nthe 1986 group profit at 60 marks, a figure BMW does not deny.\n    But Reitman was more pessimistic, predicting 50 marks per\nshare in 1987, and a return to 60 next year. He said: \"BMW will\nbe the story of 1988,\" when it plans to launch an updated\nversion of its Five series.\n    BMW also has a big investment programme under way and Bil's\nFischer said depreciations could affect earnings. Other\nanalysts pointed to possible hedging problems and Reitman noted\na 2.10 marks to the dollar hedge expired this September.\n    Reitman said the outlook for Porsche was bearish for the\nyear to end-July, 1987. Porsche's 1985/86 group profits at 84\nmarks per share fell 30 pct from the record 120 marks in\n1984/85 and Reitman saw 60 marks in 1986/87.\n    \"With the U.S. Currently accounting for 63 pct of unit sales\n(this is expected to fall to 60 pct in the full year 1986/87)\nPorsche's earnings remain uncomfortably exposed to the\nDM/dollar relationship,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 1-JUN-1987 05:02:05.63","places":["west-germany","japan"]},"17475":{"title":"BAA PLC UNIT WINS KANSAI AIRPORT CONTRACT","body":"<British Airport Services Ltd> (BAS) has\nconcluded an 18 mln yen contract with the <Kansai International\nAirport Co Ltd> for consulting work on the terminal at a new\nairport to be built in western Japan, the airport company said\nin a statement.\n    The contract is the first to be awarded to a British\ncompany and follows the award of a 200,000 dlr consultancy\ncontract to a division of the U.S-based <Bechtel International\nCorp> in consortium with six Japanese companies, a company\nspokesman told Reuters.

But\nthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change\nsides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.\n    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning\nthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained\ndangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.\n    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per\nmillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to\napply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra\ncake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.\n    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it\nis not properly dried or ground.\n    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in\nLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC\nstandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,\nbut this was likely to take several years of research.\n    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total\ncoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.\n    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's\ndepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways of\navoiding the copra process altogether.\n    \"There are ways of producing coconut products outside of\ncopra,\" Romero said. \"We can process fresh coconut without drying\nthe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process\ncoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to\nthe chemical root.\"\n    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to\nbecome more protectionist and he expected export prices of\ncoconut products to drop.\n    \"In the long term we will be getting less and less for more\nand more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,\" he\nsaid.\n    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up\nproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil\noutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.\n    \"To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending\nbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by\nsaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,\"\nhe said.\n    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to\nstay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a\nhigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,\nand a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.\n    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year\ncoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall\nafter two successive years of good harvests.\n    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to\nadd to the production fall, drought had affected output.\n    \"Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the\nprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep\nprices stable is by processing, adding more value,\" he said.\n    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by\nplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.\n    \"A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on\n10,000 square metres of land.

The fastest\nsupercomputers can perform more than a billion calculations per\nsecond, greater than the combined power of 100,000 personal\ncomputers.\n    They also carry stratospheric price tags of between one mln\nto 20 mln dlrs each, which is why Cray's revenues could reach\n600 mln dlrs last year even though it only shipped 36 new and\n10 used supercomputers, a level that would spell starvation for\nany standard computer company.        \n    But speakers at the supercomputer exhibition emphasized\nthat a host of new applications should increase total industry\nshipments to 150 systems a year by the end of the decade.\n    Most commercial customers of supercomputers now use the\nmachines to simulate a physical process, such as the flow of\nair over an aircraft wing, in design and testing work.\n    But financial institutions, particularly Wall Street\nbrokerage houses, are considered the next major buyers of\nsupercomputers as they try to recognize changes in stock\ntrading patterns faster than any of their competitors.\n    Two firms, Goldman Sachs and Co and Morgan Stanley and Co,\nare now using superminicomputers, hybrid machines that are\nfaster than a minicomputer but cheaper than a super, to create\nfinancial models of the stock and bond markets.\n    Analysts said it is only a matter of time before actual\nsupercomputers are found on Wall Street.\n    One reason for the shift to commercial applications is that\nsupercomputers are coming down in price as new technologies\nprovide greater speed at lower costs than the Cray and Control\nData behemoths.\n    Both the ETA and Thinking Machines Systems use a technology\ncalled parallel processing, in which a number of internal\nprocessors work together to solve a problem.\n    With such systems a problem is broken up and different\nsegments are assigned to different processors. By contrast,\nstandard computers solve a problem one instruction at a time,\nor sequentially.\n    The ETA system, the ETA 10, will eventually use as many as\neight parallel processors capable of processing up to 8.32\nbillion operations per second.\n    However, the first ETA 10, installed at Florida State\nUniversity, has only two processors, later to be expanded to\nfour.  ETA president Lloyd Thorndyke said the ETA 10 represents\na drastic change in architecture from parent company Control\nData's Cyber system.\n    Priced from 5.5 mln to 22 mln dlrs, the ETA 10 contains\nabout 240 chips in each of its processing units, built onto a\nboard about the size of a standard newspaper section.\n    Each of these boards contains the equivalent of 1.5 miles\nof embedded wiring.\n    It took ETA about 3-1/2 years to develop its supercomputer\nbut Thorndyke said he expects much faster development time\nframes in the futre, from both ETA and its competitors.\n    \"We're in a leapfrog business and we just took the last\nleap,\" he said.\n    Thinking Machines also claims to have the world's fastest\ncomputer and in some ways this is true. Its Connection Machine\nModel CM-2 can process 2.5 billion instructions per second, but\nit is a very specialized architecture only meant for certain\nvery specific applications.\n    The one mln to five mln dlr Connection Machine uses a\ntechnology called \"massive parallism.\" It contains 64,000\nprocessors crammed into a five foot cube. The processors all\nwork on a problem at once, breaking it down into minute bits.\n    It is an ideal tool for applications with many\nunpredicatble variables, according to Brian Boyle, analyst for\nNovon Research Group. \"The more unpredictable things are, the\nmore the Thinking Machine will be appropriate,\" he said.       \n\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 1-JUN-1987 08:58:28.17","places":["usa"]},"17498":{"title":"FLUOR RETAINS SHEARSON TO ASSESS VALUE OF GOLD OPERATIONS\n","date":" 1-JUN-1987 09:03:20.03"},"17499":{"title":"DUTCH COCOA PROCESSORS UNHAPPY WITH ICCO BUFFER","body":"Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with\nthe intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa\nOrganization's buffer stock manager, industry sources told\nReuters.\n    \"The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost\nnothing to support the market.

However, he\nsaid new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation\nexpectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates\nin the longer term.\n    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,\nor even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts\npoint to a falling rate of economic growth.\n    \"It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement\nnegotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,\"\nthe ABN economist said.\n    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in\nJanuary, could also contribute to some inflation.\n    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to\ntwo pct next year.

Streptokinase, an enzyme-based drug, is also used to\ntreat heart attack victims.\n    In addition, Milstein said that Beecham Group Plc <BHAM.L>\nhas a drug called Eminase which is \"the most likely competitor\nto TPA,\" and from a clinical standpoint, nearly identical.\nBeecham's drug has been approved for use in Germany and is\nawaiting approval in the U.K., he added.\n     Streptokinase was difficult to administer to heart attack\nvictims because it would dissolve before it reached the heart.\nAnother method, which involved pumping the drug directly into\nthe heart through a tube, proved difficult when a heart attack\nwas in progress. TPA was seen as a savior since it was easier\nto administer and worked quickly.\n    But new developments have made streptokinase more effective\nand easier to administer, becoming a potential threat to\nGenentech's grasp on the TPA market. And if that wasn't enough,\nabout 30 other biotech companies are quickly developing TPA in\nGenentech's path.\n \n    \"Genentech's advantage is being first in the market,\" said\nindustry consultant Scott King, formerly an analyst with\nMontgomery Securities in San Francisco. \"They'll be the first\napproved but then they'll face competition after one or two\nyears.\"\n    The company may also face patent pressures for its drug.

In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.\n    Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the\nmerger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.\n    On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six\ncompanies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.\n    For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on\nsales of 141.5 mln dlrs.\n    The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely\nbecause the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,\nDallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the\ndark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or\n56 cts a share.\n   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different\nbusinesses, only three of which were involved in computer\nsoftware. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a\nmajor Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his\njob as chairman of General Electric Co's <GE> computer services\nunit.\n    Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a\nnews conference that the merger would give computer users a\nsingle source for a wide range of software products.\n    In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also\nsell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads\nin the applications software market, where analysts said it has\nbeen successful with accounting and banking systems.\n    Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and\nenhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the\ncompany will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said\nabout 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.\n    Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of\ncurrent Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But\nthey joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute\nComputer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.\n    Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of\ncompleting acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,\nhe said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05\ndlrs a share.\n    Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations\nof the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing\nand research and development.\n    Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.\nBased on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50\ndlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly\n33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.\n    Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most\nsoftware companies are currently valued at about 20 times\nper-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the\npremium because of its earnings potential and customer base.\n\n    Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25\npct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently\nowns 58 pct of Uccel.\n    The executive said the merger would not alter his target of\nmaintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.\n    In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the\ndeal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice\nDepartment.\n    Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the\nmerger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 1-JUN-1987 14:06:52.55","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"17701":{"title":"MAXWELL WOULD NOT RENEW BID IF SUIT FAILS","body":"British press magnate Robert Maxwell said\nhis British Printing and Communication Corp Plc would not renew\nits bid for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc <HBJ> if the lawsuit\nfiled against Harcourt in New York today fails.\n    Speaking at a press conference, Maxwell denied market\nrumors that British Printing had approached British\ninstitutions to arrange a rights issue with a view to\nrelaunching its bid for the U.S. publishing concern.\n    \"I don't believe in chasing mirages,\" maxwell said.\n    British Printing filed suit in U.S. District Court in\nManhattan to block what Maxwell called a fraudulent\nrecapitalization announced by Harcourt last week.\n    Harcourt, in response to a hostile two billion dlr takeover\nproposal from Maxwell, planned a recapitalization that would\npay shareholders 40 dlrs per share.

But officials noted that Poehl has worked\nclosely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard\nStoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.\n    Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul\nVolcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international\nreputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.\n    Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook\nPoehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor\nWilly Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was\nFinance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as\nChancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.\n    In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the\ndollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of\nthe Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution\nwhich has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent\ninflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts\nof galloping inflation this century.\n    But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and\ninflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe\nto relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the\ndangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.\n    \"I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the\ndollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the\nBundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark\nwould endanger the economy in West Germany,\" he told business\njournalists in Frankfurt recently.\n    Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that\nPoehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.\n    \"Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not\nfocus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external\neconomy,\" she said.\n    An economist at a German bank, who declined to be\nidentified, said \"If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will\ncertainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so\nrigidly oriented towards money supply.\"\n    One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to\npersuade the United States to stop \"talking down\" the dollar. For\nPoehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that\nthe United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise\ncurrencies.\n    The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency\ndealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in\nfact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.\n    \"This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they\ndon't know - what the central banks can do,\" Poehl says of\nintervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates\nround, making a speculator's position worthless.\n    Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist\nin the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.\n    A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over\na glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.\n    He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and\nplay golf.\n    Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute\nfor correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.\n    \"But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount\nif you strike at the right moment,\" he said. Bundesbank dealers\nare very professional and skilled. \"They've burnt the fingers of\nmany people,\" he said.

That meant that the strategy\nbegun by top leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978 was likely to go on,\nbut at a slower pace, they said.\n    Deng has led China's overhaul of the Stalinist economy\nbuilt during the rule of Chairman Mao. Since Mao died in 1976\nliving standards have risen sharply and China has become a net\nexporter of grain for the first time.\n    A western diplomat said China's leaders had been\nsufficiently encouraged by their success last year to order the\ndrawing up of plans for more reforms for 1987. These included\nchanges to the country's price system.\n    But he said the biggest reforms had been shelved since\neconomic problems appeared in late 1986 and the resignation of\nCommunist Party chief Hu Yaobang in January.\n    The diplomat said the most ambitious reforms would not be\non the agenda for a major party meeting later this year.\n    The main economic reform proceeding in 1987 is a system\nunder which factories sign contracts with the government. They\ncan keep any profit over and above the contract amount.\n    \"This is a modest reform, a repeat of what China did in the\nearly 1980s,\" the diplomat said.\n    \"It is regarded as second best by the reformers who drew up\nthe more ambitious plans.

Some of these reforms, like price increases,\nwere very unpopular.\n    Zhao ordered the media to give more coverage to the reforms\nand why they were necessary, the source said.\n    One of China's top economists wrote in the People's Daily\nlast week, \"Failure to answer people's questions about the new\nprices has caused great anxiety.\"\n    In March, China announced budget deficits for 1986 and\n1987. It has had two years of trade deficits, and capital\nspending and wages are rising fast.\n    On the political front, the conservatives in the Party have\nbeen on the offensive since January when Hu resigned. He\nallegedly failed to fight the growth of western democratic\nideas, which the Party has called bourgeois liberalism.\n    A nationwide drive against bourgeois liberalism has been\nunder way since January in the Party and the media. The latter\nhas given wide coverage to those in the leadership who have\nwarned against the errors of all-out westernisation.\n    The economist said, \"Although reform in any country\ninevitably causes anxiety and is often risky, it has been\nproved that, where reform is more daring, commodities are more\nabundant and people's living standards higher.\"\n    \"But in the countries that are more rigid, the market is\nstagnant, goods are in short supply and rationing is common,\" he\nsaid.\n    The diplomat said the reformers wanted to complete their\nunfinished overhaul of China's pricing system.\n    The diplomat said the reformers wanted to make factories\nindependent of the government which would use taxes, credit\nsupply and other indirect means to regulate them instead of\nadministrative diktat as in the past.\n    \"But to enact such far-reaching measures they need a stable\neconomy, contented workers and surpluses, to give them\nmanoeuvring room.

They pointed to the worrying\nbackground of slower growth, especially in Japan and Germany,\namid fears about a pickup in inflation in the U.S. Which could\nlead to higher interest rates and exacerbate the debt crisis.\n    The marginal impact that the major shifts in dollar, yen\nand mark exchange rates have had on the Japanese and German\ntrade surpluses and U.S. Trade and fiscal deficits since the\nSeptember 1985 Plaza agreement was also a cause for concern.\n    Economists said the recent rise in the dollar was likely to\nbe quickly reversed in the absence of new commitments in\nVenice.\n    But government officials do not expect summit delegations -\nfrom the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada\nand the European Community - to go much beyond restating policy\ngoals enshrined in the February Louvre agreement of Group of\nSeven finance ministers and central bankers.\n    Under the agreement, aimed at halting the dollar's 20-month\ndecline and at fostering balanced growth, Japan and West\nGermany would work to eliminate their trade and payments\nsurpluses in return for a U.S. Pledge to reduce fiscal\ndeficits.\n    A 6,000 billion yen package announced by Prime Minister\nYasuhiro Nakasone last week went some way towards that goal and\nappeared to have saved Japan from a widely anticipated summit\nattack on its economic policies, officials said.\n    The package, featuring government spending and tax cuts to\nstimulate demand, drew a cautious welcome in European capitals\nbut its reception in the U.S. Was much more enthusiastic.\n    Treasury Secretary James Baker commented, \"Of course,\nimplementation is the key, but this is clearly forward movement\ntoward fulfillment by Japan of its commitments.\"\n    With Japan signalling its willingness to boost domestic\ndemand rather than rely on exports for growth, the U.S. And\nother summit countries were now set to shift their attention to\nWest Germany and press Kohl for similar action, officials said.\n    U.S. Assistant treasury secretary David Mulford said there\nwas worldwide concern that German economic growth has flagged,\nand the U.S. Would demand that Kohl confirm a commitment that\npolicies would be reviewed if growth continued sluggish.\n    But West German officials said Kohl would fiercely resist\nany such pressure. One senior Bonn official said, \"There is just\nno room for manoeuvre for any economic moves.\"\n    Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has problems finding\ncash to finance tax cuts promised for 1990, and is reluctantly\nletting government borrowing rise, Bonn officials said.\n    Citing fierce opposition by West Germany and Britain,\nEuropean officials also ruled out progress on U.S. Plans for a\nmore formal strategy for coordinating economic policies, based\non a series of economic indicators.\n    The U.S. Wants other Group of Seven countries to agree to\nhigh level consultations when the indicators, including trade,\ngrowth, interest and exchange rates, inflation and fiscal\ndeficits, show members are not living up to economic\ncommitments.\n  But Germany and Britain fear the plan would undermine\neconomic sovereignty, and Britain also feels the proposals are\ntoo complicated and too rigid, officials said.\n    Recent developments on Third World debt, including moves by\ntwo of the largest U.S. Banks to set aside billions of dollars\nto cover bad loans, will feature prominently in the talks.\n    U.S. And Japanese officials said they would seek to\nreactivate the Baker initiative at the summit and renew a call\nto commercial banks to come up with a \"menu of alternatives\" to\nrestore some new bank lending to debtor countries.\n    Officials said there was also scope for agreement on a\nFranco-British plan aimed at alleviating the burden for the\nworld's poorest debtor countries through concessional\nrescheduling of their sovereign debt at the Paris Club.\n    The talks would also include plans to dismantle runaway\nfarm subsidies all summit nations pay to guarantee the income\nof their farmers and secure a share of world markets, they\nsaid.\n    The 24 members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation\nand Development (OECD) last month supported a gradual\ndecoupling of farm production subsidies from income support for\nfarmers.\n    The U.S., Canada and Britain in particular are keen to move\nquickly after the OECD breakthrough, officials said.\n    \"What we want is not for treasuries to compete as they do\nnow.

They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably\nequities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.\n    Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower\ninterest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse\nthe loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.\n    Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves\nnews, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of\ncurrencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0\npct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.\n    \"The market doesn't want to do anything because of the\nelection,\" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.\n    Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of\na rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had\noverestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to\nhave been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the\nforward market.\n    The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of\nsterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth\nthe pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention\nreported in May probably occurred in April, they said.\n    The key three months interbank money market rates eased\nabout 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend\nin U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves\nnews, analysts said.\n    Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was\nmuted as traders worried about the funding implications of\nanother huge rise in reserves, they added.\n    Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut\nfrom the current nine pct level soon after the election, so\nlong as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove\naccurate, with another half point later.\n    Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse\nBuckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be\npossible. \"Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in\nfuture, rather than this active intervention,\" he predicted.\n    Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned\nagainst over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut\nlooked likely.\n    A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.\n    \"The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political\nproblem of cutting rates during an election campaign ...

This would leave a budget deficit\nbefore borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of\nGDP.\n    The government, having consistently overshot its own\nspending targets for more than a decade, also faces a\ncredibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the\nbudget, analysts said.\n    \"The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,\"\nsaid Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.\n    Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less\nattention to the figures presented in the budget and are using\ntheir own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the\nmoney and capital markets.\n    South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending\nwill again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49\nbillion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5\npct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the\nIMF.\n    \"The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,\" predicted\none analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away\nfrom austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past\ntwo years.\n    The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the\npolitical situation and the onset of an economic crisis\ntriggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over\nloans to the country in September 1985.\n    Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling\nper capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,\ngovernment officials say economic growth is the prime\nobjective.\n    But private-sector economists caution that the government's\nability to promote growth by boosting state spending is\nconstrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the\ncurrent account of the country's balance of payments.\n    Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5\nbillion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the\nnation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an\narrangement reached earlier this year with major international\ncreditor banks.\n    Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has\nlittle room to manoeuvre.\n    Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and\nbudgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and\nSouth African Transport Services suggest that major tax\nconcessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.\n    Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions\nfor taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only\nelection.

It also had some effect in undermining the Bank's role\nin the global debt strategy, the sources said.\n    At the center of the controversy is Bank President Barber\nConable, whose reorganization efforts are getting some \ncritical review from many Bank staff members and some member-\ncountries including the United States.\n    \"I think if he were to do it again, he would do it very\ndifferently,\" said one source.\n    Conable, a former congressman from New York appointed by\nPresident Reagan to the senior most position at the Bank nearly\na year ago, has taken the view that the Bank badly needed to be\nreorganized and perhaps made more streamlined.\n    In this he had the backing of many in the Reagan\nadministration who viewed the Bank as a bloated and inefficient\nbureaucracy that gave money to countries when other free-market\nsources of assistance were available.\n    However, the Bank had been singled out for a much greater\nrole under the U.S. debt initiative proposed by Treasury\nSecretary James Baker.  That strategy, which called for some 20\nbillion dlrs in new funding from the commerical banks and nine\nbillion dlrs in spending from the development banks, mostly the\nWorld Bank, came under profound doubt with the decision by\nCitibank and Chase Manhattan to set aside new reserves.\n    This move, heralded by some sources as a measure that gives\nall parties more time, frightened others, who see it as the\nbeginning of a tit for tat exercise that could lead to complete\nunraveling of the monetary system.\n    As envisioned by the latter, the next move would be for\nBrazil, which has delayed payments on its debts, to say it does\nnot intend to pay interest for a very long period of time.\n    Citibank and other banks could then decide to stop\nfinancing the country's export credits, the funds countries use\nto support their daily activities, leading to an economic\nbreakdown.\n    \"Within six weeks alot of countries could be out of\nbusiness,\" said one source.\n    Citibank's initial step last month was to set some three\nbillion dlrs in a general reserve for potential losses on loans\nto developing countries.  It was followed by a similar move by\nChase Manhattan some days later.\n    In the best of all worlds, the kind of cooperation that was\ndemonstrated between the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the\nmultilateral development banks, the wealthy countries and\ncommercial banks when the debt crisis surfaced in 1982, could\nemerge again but no one is expecting that.\n    If anything, the negotiations have become much more\nconfrontational with the debtor countries pressing for more\nconcessions, arguing that they face growing political\ninstability if they are asked to do or pay more.\n    They are very critical of the IMF's austerity measures and\nthere is sympathy for their view among the development\ncommunity.\n    \"When you hear code words like structural adjustment and\ntightening your belt.  What that means is that the poor peasent\nmaking 700 dlrs a year should drop it to 500 dlrs,\" says one\nsource.\n    He adds: \"And when your hear they should have market forces\nat play, that means the level of public services should drop.\"\n    It had been hoped that giving the World Bank a greater role\nin the debt strategy might defuse the growing resistance in the\ndebtor countries to measures that increased already prevalent\npoverty even further.\n   The Bank, which primarily assists countries in the building\nof roads, sewerage systems, education, and other so-called\ninfrastructure, is viewed in the Third World as benefactor.\n   The IMF, however, which essentially forged the debt stategy\nfollowing the disclosure by Mexico in 1982 that it was near\ndefault, is considered a stern taskmaster that has little\nsympathy or even understanding of poverty.\n    But there are doubts about how well the Baker initiative\nhas worked and about the World Bank's success at bringing about\nincreased growth in the Third World under the U.S. prescription\nwhich indicated that countries might grow their way out of\ntheir difficulty.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 2-JUN-1987 09:07:59.49","organisations":["imf"],"places":["usa"]},"17977":{"title":"GM UNIT <GMH> NEGOTIATING FOR BRITISH CONTRACT","body":"General Motors Corp's Hughes\nAircraft Co subsidiary said it has been chosen by British\nSatellite Broadcasting to negotiate for a contract worth about\n300 mln dlrs to deliver two satellites for direct broadcast\ntelevision.\n    The company said the first of the satellites is scheduled\nto start up three channels of direct broadcast satellite\ntelevision by late 1989.\n    The company said the contract should be signed by June 30. \nEach satellite would be equipped with three 110-watt channels.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 2-JUN-1987 09:08:47.97","places":["usa"]},"17978":{"title":"RESDEL <RSDL.O>, SAN/BAR <SBAR.O> IN MERGER DEAL","body":"Resdel Industries Inc said\nit has agreed to acquire San/Bar Corp in a share-for-share\nexchange, after San/Bar distributes all shgares of its\nBreak-Free Corp subsidiary to San/Bar shareholders on a\nshare-for-share basis.\n    The company said also before the merger, San/Bar would\nBarry K.

This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six\nmonths of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the\nsame period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.\n    CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.\n\n    ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond\ndescribing it as a long term investment.\n    ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is\na leader in building materials, Herbert said.\n    \"We fit better with Monier,\" he said.\n    CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its\ncore businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves\ninto energy several years ago.\n    Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert\nsaid: \"I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to\nwonder if Monier is the main target.\"\n\n    Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a\nhigher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.\n    Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its\noriginal bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.\n    The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on\nyesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign\nshareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review\nBoard (FIRB) approval.

Redland held discussions on a\npossible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the\nnegotiations foundered on the price.\n    Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not\nthink ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid\nalthough Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.\n    \"Redland is still in the driving seat,\" said Tim Cohen of\n<Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having\nCSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.\n    Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.\n\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 2-JUN-1987 09:41:32.00","topics":["acq"],"places":["australia"]},"17987":{"title":"WESTPORT BANCORP <WBAT.O> 100 PCT STOCK DIVIDEND","body":"Westport Bancorp Inc said it\ndeclared a 100 pct stock dividend and increased the quarterly\ncash dividend.\n    The company said the the stock dividend, to effect a\ntwo-for-one stock split, is payable July six to holders of\nrecord June 12.\n    It said the dividend on present shares was increased to 26\ncts, from 25 cts in the prior quarter, payable July one to\nholders of record June 12.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 2-JUN-1987 09:41:46.74","places":["usa"]},"17988":{"title":"COMP-U-CARD INTERNATIONAL INC <CUCD.O> 1ST QTR","body":"Periods ended April 30\n    Shr 18 cts vs 15 cts\n    Net 3,309,000 vs 2,539,000\n    Revs 45.2 mln vs 26.8 mln\n    Avg shrs 18.7 mln vs 16.8 mln\n    NOTE: 1986 net includes gain of 1,197,000 dlrs, or seven\ncts a share, from tax loss carryforwards\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 2-JUN-1987 09:42:15.49","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"17989":{"title":"COMP-U-CARD <CUCD.O> PLANS NAME CHANGE","body":"Comp-U-Card International Inc\nsaid it intends to change its name to CUC International Inc.\n    It said shareholders will be asked to approve the new name\nat the annual meeting on June 16\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 2-JUN-1987 09:42:57.55","places":["usa"]},"17990":{"title":"HOG AND CATTLE SLAUGHTER GUESSTIMATES","body":"Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor traders\nand commission house representatives are guesstimating today's\nhog slaughter at about 265,000 to 275,000 head versus 286,000\nweek ago and 278,000 a year ago.\n    Cattle slaughter is guesstimated at about 128,000 to\n132,000 head versus 132,000 week ago and 137,000 a year ago.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 2-JUN-1987 09:43:04.63"},"17991":{"title":"AFRICAN BANK OFFICIAL CONFIDENT ON LOAN REPAYMENTS","body":"The Secretary-General of the African\nDevelopment Bank expressed confidence in the institution's\nability to handle potential problems with repayment of\ndevelopment financing loans.\n    Koffi Dei-Anang told a news conference at the bank's\nheadquarters that loan arrears were only 80 mln dlrs at\npresent, a small percentage of total ADB lending which exceeded\none billion dlrs in 1986.\n    Some commercial banks have recently taken extraordinary\nmeasures to deal with third world lending strategies.\n    \"We do have difficulty with repayment of loans on time,\"\nDei-Anang said.
