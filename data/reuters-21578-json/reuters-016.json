Interest rates fell\nsharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.\n    But that confidence is now cracking as the financial\nmarkets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's\noften-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.\n    \"Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar\nfreefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,\" said\nDavid Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.\n    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in\n40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington\nfailed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a\ncredible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short\nof further depreciation of the dollar.\n    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid\nworries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare\naway foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.\n    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12\ndlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike\nin interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down\nby 33 points to 2339.\n    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the\nmarkets' instability frightening. He believes economic\nfundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"once\nyou start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.\"\n    \"There's a stark possibility that you could get a\ndestabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates\nand drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\"\n    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics\nin Washington, has been warning for a long time that the\ncontrolled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and\n264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.\n    \"We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But\nthe agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters.\n    Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this\nyear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it\nwould take very little to touch off what he calls the second\nphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the\ndollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.\n    The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on\nMarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.\n    The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with\nhistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are\nnot affected until a currency is in the final stages of its\ndecline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.\n    Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest\nweakness was the loss of credibility that central banks\nsuffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling\nbelow 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as\npart of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.\n    Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of\nconfidence was triggered last week when Washington announced\nplans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic\nimports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.\n    Many economists believe that long-run stability will not\nreturn to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is\naddressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the\nmassive budget deficit.\n    But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of\ncentral bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no\nchoice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.\n    \"The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a\nsubstantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding\ncut abroad, at least by Japan,\" said Lanston's Jones.\n    Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest\nrates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for\nAmerican farmers, Latin American governments and others.\n    But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and\nCo, scoffed at the notion. \"It's ridiculous to think the Federal\nReserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak\nagainst just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar\nweakness,\" he said.\n    Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being\nmade toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.\n    \"We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the\nbudget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody\ncares,\" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69\nwill have been greater.\n    He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and\nthinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.\n    But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that\na further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. \"Put on\nyour helmets,\" Giordano said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 9-APR-1987 21:41:33.32","topics":["money-fx","interest"],"places":["usa"]},"16073":{"title":"MIYAZAWA TO HOLD PRESS CONFERENCE LATER TODAY","body":"Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is\nexpected to hold a press conference later today after returning\nfrom Washington, a ministry spokesman told Reuters.\n    Miyazawa is scheduled to arrive at 4.15 P.M.

But other changes, including\nrevisions in the domestic options market and introduction of\nfutures contracts, need lengthy statutory changes and this may\ntake years, bankers and dealers say.\n    Deutsche Bank AG co-chairman F. Wilhelm Christians called\nlast week for an enlargement of current capital market\ninstruments to include instruments already standard abroad.\n    He said these are needed especially when prices fall,\nciting declines in West German share prices in the first two\nmonths of this year when stock indices fell about 20 pct.\n    Others are more blunt. Securities dealers say the lack of\nviable hedging instruments for shares and bonds makes trading\nin domestic markets too risky.\n    \"We need a stock index futures contract, and a futures\ncontract for recent government bonds,\" one dealer said.\n    West Germany now has options contracts on about five pct of\nshares and bonds traded on exchanges here, covering only about\n30 pct of the average traded volume, stock market sources said.\n    Options can only be written on the original 14 bonds\nselected when bond options were introduced last April. The most\nrecent bond on the list was issued in 1985.\n    There are no futures exchanges in West Germany. German\nbanks may participate in futures exchanges through branches\nabroad but these are at least outwardly subject to stringent\nWest German rules requiring that every contract be secured on a\none-by-one basis with a separate hedge, to prevent speculation.\n    Another problem is a lack of liquidity in the existing\nmarkets, owing to lack of private investor participation.\n    Private individuals and corporations do not engage in\noptions trading now due to West Germany's civil and exchange\nlaws, which define losses made in futures and options business\nas gambling losses, which investors need not pay back.\n    Options business has been hurt by lack of liquidity from\npension funds, which currently are forbidden to invest in these\ninstruments. But they are to be allowed to enter the business\nsoon as the European Community begins to harmonize rules\ngoverning funds.\n    Manfred Laux, general secretary of the West German mutual\nfunds association in Frankfurt, said harmonized rules are to be\nadopted by October 1, 1989 at the latest.\n    The push to adopt new instruments has not been great in the\npast, owing to wide-spread belief they are speculative, which\ngives them a bad name in West Germany. But pressure for their\nintroduction here is growing.\n    The start-up of a Swiss futures exchange has some bankers\nconsidering if a similar exchange would be useful in West\nGermany. They say that without innovations, some business could\ndrift to London, which the Bundesbank vehemently opposes.\n    An official at the London International Financial Futures\nExchange (LIFFE) said the exchange currently has no plans to\nintroduce more mark-denominated contracts beyond the existing\nmark-dollar contract. But he said the exchange is studying the\nfeasibility of other contracts, including one for three-month\nmark interest rates and possibly a government bond contract.\n    A Bundesbank capital markets expert said the Bundesbank has\nno objections to hedging through futures but any liberalization\nin that sector is still in the early planning stages after\nearlier talks ended two years ago.\n    Considerations about the futures business have been drawn\nout because of the large number of participants involved in\ntalks. They include parliament, the Bundesbank, the Federal\nBanking Supervisory Board, eight West German stock exchanges\nand their governing states, and the four West German banking\nassociations.\n    Beyond options and futures, other changes being suggested\ninclude replacing the federal government's current bond\nconsortium with an auction procedure similar to one being\nconsidered in the U.K. And already in practice in the U.S.\n    This would upset the existing market order providing German\nand foreign banks in the consortium with fixed quotas but it\nwould eliminate the misallocations some bankers say presently\narise within the fixed consortium quota system.\n    In addition, some bankers would like the method of bond\ntrading on the West German stock exchange changed to a system\nof continuous price-setting from the current system in which\nevery bond price is fixed once a day.\n    This would make trading more transparent if it reduced the\nproportion of off-floor interbank bond trading, now some 90 pct\nof the volume of bond transactions here, the bankers say.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"13-APR-1987 04:00:17.66","places":["west-germany"]},"16129":{"title":"MALAYSIAN TREASURY BILL RISES AT LATEST TENDER","body":"The central bank, Bank Negara,\nsaid yields on the 91-day Malaysian treasury bills rate rose\nslightly to 2.032 pct at this week's tender from 2.020 pct last\nweek.\n    Accepted bids ranged between 1.951 and 2.060 pct compared\nwith 1.874 and 2.048 pct previously.

Convinced they are here to stay,\ninvestment bankers are attempting to adapt MTNs for the\neuromarket.\n    Ralph Bunche, a vice president of Morgan Stanley\nInternational, predicted at a recent Euromoney conference on\nMTNs here that they will become the predominant instrument for\nraising funds in the late 1980's and 1990's. \"It (the MTN\nmarket) will even surpass the bond market,\" he said.\n    Other bankers took exception with the degree to which MTNs\nwill grow. But they generally agreed that these instruments\nprovide the borrower with greater flexibility and lower costs\nthan a traditional bond.\n    The trick is in convincing European borrowers it is worth\narranging a program and, having accomplished that, to persaude\nEuropean investors -- whose preferences differ from their U.S.\nCounterparts -- to buy the securities.\n    Discussions with bankers proved one thing. No one is\nexactly sure how to proceed with structuring and marketing\nthese issues.\n    To date only 13 Euro-MTN programs have been announced but\nonly a few have been activated, such as those for a unit of\nPepsiCo Inc and another for AB Electrolux.\n    Several firms have devised different structures for\nEuro-MTNs and defend their structures adamantly.\n    The PepsiCo notes, for example, are sold on a continuously\noffered basis. This involves a small amount of new notes with\nsimilar maturities constantly on offer at current market rates.\n    The Electrolux program uses multi-tranche tap notes devised\nby Merrill Lynch. Under this structure, an initial tranche of a\nminimum 50 mln dlrs has a fixed rate of interest and maturity.\nThe borrower then issues additional notes in this category up\nto a pre-determined maximum.\n    Those who defend the continuously offered method, such as\nWendy Dietze, a Salomon Brothers Inc vice president, point to\nthe flexibility they offer in interest rate and maturity.\n    Furthermore, she believes this structure offers the\nEuropean investor greater confidence in market liquidity -- a\nmajor concern for these buyers.\n    Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd's Kevin Regan defends the\nmedium-tranche tap notes concept saying it offers comparable\nliquidity. But he also said that this structure may not be the\nright option for all borrowers.\n    Peter Mortimer, a partner in the law firm Milbank, Tweed,\nHadley and McCloy, noted that legal requirements could well\ndetermine which structure is chosen.\n    He noted that the tap system allows a more clearly defined\n\"lock-up\" period as each tranche has a specific maturity. In the\ncase of notes issued by U.S. Borrowers, the \"lock-up\" period is\nthe 90 days after the completion of a series during which time\na security cannot be sold back to the U.S. Or to U.S.\nInvestors.\n    However, he said that the Securities and Exchange\nCommission is reviewing its current regulations on the\nownership of foreign securities by U.S. Citizens and that some\nsoftening in the rules could come in the not too distant\nfuture.\n    For their part borrowers say they feel a bit like guinea\npigs.\n    Petter Skouen, executive vice president of the Nordic\nInvestment Bank (NIB), noted that a few weeks ago NIB would\nhave said it was disappointed with its Euro-MTN program, but\nthat the success of a recent issue changed their minds.\n    He conceded that in retrospect it would have been wiser to\nestablish separate programs for the euromarket and the U.S.\nDomestic market, rather than try to extend the U.S. Issue\nglobally.

That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.\n    Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told\ntelevision interviewers he did not think a policy of driving\nthe dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.\n    \"It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would\nadversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would\ndrive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not\n(into) recession, into slower growth,\" he said.\n    Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the\ndollar, Balladur said: \"When a currency is maintained\nartificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is\nnot healthy.\"\n    And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to\nrecession, he said.\n    Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of\nlife, Balladur said, \"there may be adjustments of course in one\nor other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.\"\n    But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he\nmight rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.\n    U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it\nunderstood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.\n    \"The United States and the six major industrial countries\nare fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these\nagreements,\" Baker told the meetings.\n    Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which\nwrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further\ndecline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to\nstabilizing currencies at current levels.\n    Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February\n22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed\nto reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight\nprotectionism.\n    West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate\ndomestic demand and lead a global upturn.\n    Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's\npromise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.\n    The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major\naction. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable\ncurrencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at\nthe time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.\n    The Paris accord said, \"currencies (are) within ranges\nbroadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given\nthe policy commitments summarized in this statement.\"\n    Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially\nagainst the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent\nwith the agreement. \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed the\nview that around current levels their currencies are within\nranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,\" last week's\nstatement read.\n    Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were\nfocusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.\nTrade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan\nrather than prospective policy changes.

They have high hopes they will\nbe upheld if the case goes all the way to the U.S. Supreme\nCourt.\"\n    Margoshes said he did not anticipate any significant\nchanges in Texaco's oil exploration and production business\nbecause the bankruptcy filing affects only about four pct of\nthe giant oil company's 32.6 billion dlrs in annual revenues.\n    Texaco executives said the bankruptcy filing would\neffectively halt payments of stock dividends and repayment of\nits 6.8 billion dlr debt, but added that the company's assets\nfar exceeded its liabilities.\n    \"Texaco's cash flow is at a very respectable rate of about\n15 dlrs per share annually,\" Margoshes said. \"Obviously, the\npoint of Chapter 11 was not so much seeking protection from\ncreditors as it was seeking protection from the predator\nPennzoil.\"\n    The two companies have been locked in an acrimonious\nstruggle since a Texas state court jury in November 1985\nordered Texaco to pay Pennzoil 10.53 billion dlrs for\nimproperly interfering with Pennzoil's planned acquisition of\nGetty Oil Co. In a major setback for Texaco last week, the U.S.\nSupreme Court said Texaco must abide by Texas state law that\nrequires posting a bond for the full amount of the judgment\nwhile the merits of the case were appealed.\n    Although a Texas appeals court hearing was scheduled Monday\n(April 13) on Texaco's motion to reduce the amount of the bond\nrequired under state law, Texaco elected not to risk losing the\nimportant court ruling that could have required it to post more\nthan 10 billion dlrs in collateral.\n    The bankruptcy filing, analysts said, effectively freezes\nall of Texaco's obligations while it continues to appeal the\nmerits of the Pennzoil lawsuit.\n    \"This is a drastic measure,\" said Rosario Ilacqua, an\nanalyst with L.F. Rothschild in New York. \"But it's also an\nindictment of the legal system in this country in that Texaco\nwas forced to seek bankruptcy when it couldn't get a fair\nhearing.\"\n    Ilacqua predicted that the Texas jury judgment would\nultimately be overturned or whittled down from its original\n10.53 billion dlrs, an amount that is increasing by about 2.5\nmln dlrs in interest accumulated daily. Texaco has contested\nthe ruling, insisting that Pennzoil did not have a valid\ncontract under New York state law to acquire Getty Oil.\n    Suggestions by some experts that the Texaco bankruptcy\nmight be an incentive for Pennzoil to lower its settlement\ndemands, which are widely believed to be between 3 billion and\n5 billion dlrs, were discounted by indignant Pennzoil\nexecutives.\n    \"I think it makes it much more difficult to settle,\" said\nBaine Kerr, Pennzoil's retired president who has acted as the\ncompany's chief negotiator in the Texaco litigation. \"I think\nthat's one of the main reasons they did it.\"\n    Joseph Jamail, a Houston lawyer for Pennzoil, said the\ncompany had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on\nSaturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for\nbankruptcy. He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal,\nciting a confidentiality agreement between the two companies.\n    \"Texaco told us they would get back to us but instead they\nchose to go to bankruptcy court,\" Jamail said. \"This was an\nirresponsible and unneeded move.\"\n    Ilacqua also said the bankruptcy filing appeared to\neliminate any chance of settlement in the near-term.\n    \"There have been some crazy numbers floating around in\nsettlement discussions,\" Ilacqua said. \"I think 1 billion dlr\nsettlement would be more than adequate for Pennzoil.

Saudi Arabia is moving on many fronts in a manner\nthat is extraordinarily aggressive.\"\n    The speed of reform, begun last year but now gathering\npace, has surprised bankers who have had to contend with a\nfinancial system that restricted internationalisation of the\nriyal and a religious court system that made debt collecting\ndifficult.\n    Saudi banks, once the most profitable in the world, have\ngenerally reported falling profits for 1986 -- the fourth\nsuccessive year of decline -- as loan loss provisions ate into\nalready dwindling earnings.\n    Bankers say the Saudi Finance Ministry and Saudi Arabian\nMonetary Agency (SAMA) seem to have developed a new strategy\nalthough it remains to be seen how it will be implemented.\n    Reform started in 1986 with measures to boost previously\ndormant stock trading, but took off in earnest this year.\n    -- From January 1, SAMA liberalised the money market,\ngiving banks greater access to liquidity aid via repurchase\nagreements.\n    -- From March 22, the Finance Ministry abolished\nwithholding tax on funds borrowed by Saudi banks abroad.\n    -- From the same date, banks were notified of a new\ncommittee to be set up under the auspices of SAMA to hear bank\ndisputes with creditors over non-payment of loans.\n    -- Also from the same date, banks were allowed to use\nmortgages as collateral for lending, banned since 1981.\n    -- Within a few weeks, the Kingdom's first stock market\ntrading floor is expected to be opened.\n    Housed in central Riyadh in the building of the Saudi\nIndustrial Development Fund, the floor will initially be used\nto trade shares on an auction system. Staff from each of the 11\ncommercial banks have been trained ahead of the launch and a\nnew computer network has been set up.\n    One banker said: \"The abolition of withholding tax will give\nbanks the opportunity to participate in new instruments such as\ninterest rate or currency swaps. At last SAMA and the Finance\nMinistry are opening up markets for investment banking.\"\n    Bankers say Saudi authorities appear to have been shocked\ninto reform by pressure from banks and alarm at bank reluctance\nto extend further loans to the private sector.\n    Banks have lobbied hard for change, arguing that the\nreligious, or Sharia, legal framework was inconsistent with the\nKingdom's western banking system and made it nigh impossible\nfor them to collect interest on bad loans through the courts.\n    As a result, many banks had virtually stopped new lending,\nbut found themselves cut off from world investment banking by a\nseries of restrictions. Withholding tax made it punitively\nexpensive to take part in interest rate or currency swaps.\n    The private sector's frustration at the virtual standstill\nin bank lending overflowed at a businessmen's conference in the\nmountain resort in Abha last month and some powerful merchant\nfamilies also called for change, bankers said.\n    \"Banks lobbied hard and had the ultimate weapon to force\nchange -- they stopped lending,\" another banker said. \"That was\nstifling growth of the economy.\"\n    It is still unclear whether the new committee that will be\nset up to hear bank disputes with creditors will prove any more\nefficient than another non-Sharia system already in force, the\nCommittees for the Settlement of Commercial Disputes (CSCDs).\n    Some bankers believe the new committee, yet to be formed,\nwill simply delay pending cases and force banks into a series\nof private deals with creditors.\n    Nor is it clear what stance the new committee will take on\ninterest payments, generally not recognised under Islamic law.\n    But other bankers say the move is clear recognition by SAMA\nand the Finance Ministry that Sharia courts and the CSCDs were\nnot the correct bodies for hearing bank disputes.\n    Other reforms have been taken or are in the pipeline.\nFinance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail said in March that a\nnew body would examine late government payments to contractors.\n    In addition, further moves are under way to align business\nlife to the Gregorian calendar year, with companies being urged\nto adopt it as their financial year.\n    A black list of borrowers, started more than two years ago\nby banks, has recently been effectively sanctioned by SAMA,\nbankers say.\n    Banks are now not permitted to lend or engage in securities\ntransactions with any party on the list.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"13-APR-1987 10:19:08.15","places":["saudi-arabia"]},"16293":{"title":"GENERAL NUTRITION FILES FOR SECONDARY OFFERING OF EIGHT MLN COMMON SHARES\n","date":"13-APR-1987 10:25:09.97"},"16294":{"title":"IRVING BANK CORP <V> 1ST QTR NET","body":"Shr 1.51 dlr vs 1.62 dlr\n    Net 28.6 mln vs 30.4 mln\n    Assets 23.8 billion vs 20.9 billion\n    Deposits 15.5 billion vs 14 billion\n    Loans 13.8 billion vs 12 billion\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"13-APR-1987 10:28:07.22","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"16295":{"title":"GENERAL NUTRITION <GNC> FILES FOR OFFERING","body":"General Nutrition Inc filed a\nregistration statement with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission for a secondary offering of eight mln common shares.\n    All the shares are being sold by the estate of David\nShakarian, the founder of the company.

the government's offering of\nits securities when the first auctions begin in Mid-May, the\nBank of England said.\n    In an official notice released today, the Bank said \"There\nwill be no formal or informal underwriting arrangement for the\nauctions but the Bank encourages all gilt-edged market makers,\nas part of their commitment to the market, to participate\nactively in the auction process.\"\n    The Bank was originally believed to have favoured requiring\nthe dealers to underwrite auctions, which are patterned after\nthose in the U.S. Treasury market.\n    However, the Treasury was believed to have baulked at the\nrequest by the 27 market makers for an allotment commission\nwhich would discourage the largest institutional investors from\nplacing orders for new stock directly through the Bank of\nEngland, thus denying primary dealers some of their best\ncustomers. Commission would have been passed along to customers\nwho did place orders via the primary dealers, making it less\nexpensive to buy through them than to go directly to the Bank.\n    Market sources said the Bank had, in its discussions with\nthe dealers about the upcoming auctions, agreed that the\nallotment commission was reasonable if the dealers had a\nconcurrent commitment to buy at the auction regardless of\nmarket conditions.\n    Indeed, the Bank and the gilts dealers are believed to be\ndisappointed that the Treasury has not agreed to go along with\nthe plan. However, in its paper, the Bank suggested that any\nconditions applied for the first few auctions may be abandoned\nor modified in future sales of gilts if they prove inefficient\nor unwieldy.\n    Among other items in the document, the Bank said its first\nauction will consist of up to 1.25 billion stg in conventional\nshort-dated stock and have a maturity of seven years or less.\n    Subsequent auctions to be held in the 1987-88 financial\nyear would first be of up to one billion stg of long-dated\nstock having a maturity of 15 years or longer and then of up to\none billion stg of medium dated stock of seven to 15 years in\nmaturity.\n    The remainder of the gilt-edged funding program would be\nmet by traditional tap offerings of stock via the government\nbroker.\n    To protect the buyers of the newly auctioned stock, the\nBank has agreed to establish a so-called fallow period, a\n28-day period during which it agrees not to issue any new stock\nof the same type, and it will not necessarily resume selling\nthe stock once the fallow period expires.\n    In the event that prices offered for the stock to be sold\nare substantially out of line with market conditions, the Bank\nwill agree to take the stock onto its own books.\n    The bank would then be free to sell the stock during the\nfallow period but not at a price below the minimum tender\nprice.\n    The Bank also said that at least initially, auctions will\nbe alloted on a bid price basis, a system under which bidders\nare allotted stock at the price which they bid.\n    However, the Bank said it reserves the right to limit any\nmoney market maker from buying more than 25 pct of a single\nauction. The Bank is widely believed to be concerned about\npreventing a single market maker from cornering a stock to\ndrive the price up.\n   The Bank has repeatedly signalled its intention to prevent\ndealers from cornering the market in a stock, issuing\nadditional stock, on occasion, to end a market shortage.\n    The Bank has also agreed to publish information about the\nauction results as soon as possible after the sale is complete,\nwhich is widely expected to be on the same day.\n    Information to be released will include the amount of stock\nallotted in terms of both competitive and non-competitive bids,\nand the highest, lowest and average price of the successful\nbids.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"13-APR-1987 11:43:44.30","places":["uk"]},"16382":{"title":"GULF OF MEXICO RIG COUNT DOWN SLIGHTLY THIS WEEK","body":"Utilization of offshore mobile rigs in\nthe Gulf of Mexico fell about 0.5 percentage point to 35.0 pct\nthis week, with a total of 82 working and 152 idled, Offshore\nData Services said.\n    In the European-Mediterranean area, utilization remained\nabout unchanged at 46.1 pct, after rising four percentage\npoints in the previous two weeks.

The\npartners in the space station are currently slated to be\nCanada, Japan, and the 13-nation European Space Agency, the\nlatter two of which also have or are developing their own\ncommercial space programs.\n     Until the Challenger explosion in January 1986, NASA had a\nvirtual lock on the world's commercial space cargo.\n    But after a re-evaluation of the shuttle program, President\nReagan declared last August that future U.S. shuttle flights\nwill no longer carry commercial payloads.\n    The administration's decision left Arianespace, a\nFrench-led European consortium, the only option available to\nsatellite owners and the concern quickly sold out all its\nplanned flights through 1989.\n    The company also raised its prices, from 30,000 dlrs a\nlaunch to 50,000 dlrs, but even the larger price tag did not\ndampen demand. Arianespace sighned 18 new contracts last year,\ncompared with 11 in 1985.\n    Those kind of tariffs have caused even non-capitalist\ncountries to try and get a piece of the action.\n    China, the Soviet Union and Japan have all announced\nsatellite launch programs and several U.S. firms, including\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp, General Dynamics Corp and Martin\nMarietta promised to spend mlns of dollars over the next three\nyears to develop their own satellite launch capabilities.\n    There will be some tremendous pent-up demand for satellite\nlaunches by then, analysts said. Without Challenger, there were\nonly three satellite launches last year, 15 fewer than in 1985\nand the lowest since 1980, when only two were sent up.\n    Ariane expects to launch from six to eight satellites a\nyear for the next three years, about 75 pct of the world's\nsatellite launches during that period.\n     McDonnell Douglas scored the biggest coup of the U.S.\nfirms in January when it won a 734 mln dlr U.S. Air Force pact\nfor up to 20 unmanned rockets to launch military satellites.\nThe contract is expected to underwrite the company's efforts to\nbuild rockets for private satellite launches.\n      Martin Marietta, however, was the first U.S. company to\nsign up a client, Federal Express Co. Marietta plans to launch\nan ExpressStar communications satellite in 1989.\n    Marietta said it will also build a version of its Titan\nrockets used by the Air Force to other private companies that\nwant to get into the satellite launch buisiness.\n    Arianespace director Charles Bigot said the U.S. companies\nwill probably become the European firm's biggest competitors\nfor satellite launching. He does not expect the national space\nprograms to become commercially viable until the late 1990s.\n    Japan has expanded its space program, launching 38\ngovernment-owned satellites in the last 16 years. But most of\nthem were small and it was only in February it launched its\nfirst satellite that circles the earth over the poles.\n    Japan also has yet to design and build its own rockets. The\nsatellite launched in February was placed in orbit by a\nMcDonnell Douglas-designed Delta rocket assembled by the\nJapanese under license.\n    Tsugo Tadakawa, director of the Washington office of\nJapan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA), said Japan\nplans to launch seven of its H-1 rockets, an American Japanese\nhybrid that replaces the Delta, through 1991. Its much larger\nsucessor, the H-II, should be ready by 1992, he said.\n    NASDA's annual budget is only about 800 mln dlrs, Tadakawa\nsaid, about 10 pct the size of NASA's yearly spending.\n    Still, NASDA is free from private competition at home and\nhas the full support of the government, since aerospace was\nchosen by the Ministry of Trade and Information as one of the\ncountry's new industries for the next decade.\n     Surprisingly, the People's Republic of China, a relative\nnewcomer to aerospace, is so far the most successful competitor\nto Ariane.\n    The country's Great Wall Industry Corp is the only national\nprogram besides the European consortium to win a private\nsatellite contract.

That spread has narrowed again.\n    \"A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,\"\nsaid Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.\n    Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is\njustified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and\nthe prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a\npercentage point.\n    He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage\npoints since last October until it fell below one point and\ntriggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.\n    \"We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon\nas this week,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G.

With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct\ntoday, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr\nround of customer repurchase agreements.\n    \"The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is\noffering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\"\nsaid Jones of Lanston.\n    \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the\nneed to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it is\nmerely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have a\nmajor impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy\novertly at some point.\"\n    Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by\nbecoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within\nfour to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.\n    Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might\nwell be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to\nfurther aid the dollar.\n    Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on\n30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate\nmay be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.\n    \"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening\npolicy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He\nsaid tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.\nLeslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures\nabate will show whether or not it is firming policy.  \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"13-APR-1987 14:23:42.44","topics":["interest","money-fx"],"places":["usa"]},"16566":{"title":"BANKAMERICA <BAC> SETS NEW BANKING SERVICE","body":"BankAmerica Corp said it has\nintroduced an electronic information and transaction service\nfor small businesses in California.\n    The bank holding company said the service, called Business\nConnection, allows customers to use personal computers to\ntransefer money between accounts, check account balances in\nBank of America business checking, savings and credit card\naccounts, and to call up checking account statements.\n    The service also allows businesses to use electronic mail\nto stop payments on checks, access commercial credit lines for\nadvancements and repayments,  and to pay bills.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"13-APR-1987 14:25:07.12","places":["usa"]},"16567":{"title":"U.S. OFFICIALS SAY NO PROGRESS ON JAPAN DISPUTE","body":"White House officials\nsaid no progress had been made in talks with Japan on a dispute\non Japanese microchip sales.\n    President Reagan's National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci\ntold reporters \"it looks like a very difficult situation at this\npoint.\"\n    The Reagan administration is due to slap 100 pct tariffs on\na range of Japanese products on Friday in retaliation for\nJapan's alleged failure to honor an agreement to stop dumping\nsemiconductors in world markets outside the U.S. and failure to\nopen its own market to U.S. goods.\n    White House chief of staff Howard Baker said that talks\nwith the Japanese had failed to provide any reason to prevent\nthe publication of a proclamation on Friday putting the new\nduties in effect.\n    \"I assume that there will be a proclamation on Friday,\" Baker\nsaid.

companies say they are willing to start trading,\"\nYates told Reuters in an interview.\n    The company last week had stated that a number of domestic\nand international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil\nshipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.\nBanks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.\n    Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and other banks told\nTexaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco\nsaid in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> and J.P.\nMorgan Co's <JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits\nto cover transactions, it said.\n    The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose\nfrom an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme\nCourt in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL> over\nthe acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.\n    The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's\nplea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.\n    \"Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they\ncould,\" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court\nruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting\nsupplies.\n    \"It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an\navalanche,\" he said. \"Supplies were cut to the point where we\ncould not run the system at anywhere near capacity.\"\n    He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in\njeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages\nby mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton\nsaid.\n    It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,\ncanceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,\nOccidental Petroleum Co <OXY> demanded cash for crude, and\nAtlantic Richfield Co <ARC> asked for special safeguards.\n    The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC <BP> last\nweek refused to accept an order for fuel oil.

<PZL> PLOTS STRATEGY TO FIGHT TEXACO","body":"Pennzoil Co, frustrated by Texaco Inc's\n<TX> decision to seek bankruptcy protection from its 10.3\nbillion dlr court judgment, is preparing to launch a new\nassault that may include investigating assets Texaco\ntransferred from its corporate parent to subsidiaries, legal\nexperts said.\n    Joe Jamail, a Houston lawyer for Pennzoil, said the company\nwould file a challenge to Texaco's bankruptcy petition sometime\nthis week accusing the oil giant of bad faith and ignoring its\nfiduciary responsibilities to shareholders.\n    The action is almost certain to ignite a new round of\ndebate between the two companies stemming from Texaco's 1984\nacquisition of Getty Oil Co for 10.2 billion dlrs, a company\nPennzoil believed it had an agreement to buy.\n    \"We're going to be doing a lot of things they may not\nlike,\" Jamail said, referring to the bankruptcy court\nproceeding in New York.\n    Some legal experts suggested that a mud-slinging battle in\nbankruptcy court between the two companies might also provoke\nCongressional interest in whether the bankruptcy code is too\nlenient because it permits a profitable firm to freeze debts.\n    Texaco, which has assets totaling 34.9 billion dlrs, sought\nprotection Sunday under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy\ncode rather than risk having a Texas appeals court order the\ncompany to post a security bond for the entire amount of the\nPennzoil judgment.\n    Gerald Treece, dean of the South Texas College of Law and\nan observer of the litigation during the past three years, said\nPennzoil was unlikely to prove Texaco is not qualified to be in\nbankruptcy court simply because the giant oil company has a\npositive cash flow and assets that far exceed its liabilities.\n    But Pennzoil may be successful in raising the issue of\nwhether Texaco improperly transferred certain assets from the\ncorporate parent into subsidiaries unaffected by the bankruptcy\nfiling, Treece said.\n    \"Pennzoil's lawyers are going to be like dogs barking at\nthe heels of Texaco wherever they go,\" Treece said, \"I think\npeople are going to be surprised at the level of intensity that\nPennzoil will use in searching for hidden Texaco assets.\"\n    Jamail said Pennzoil objected to Texaco's transfer of an\noil refinery and chemical plant in Port Arthur, Texas from its\ncorporate parent to a subsidiary on Dec. 9, 1985, one day\nbefore a state court judge entered the record jury award\nagainst Texaco. Jamail suggested that the refinery and chemical\nplant, valued at about 1.1 billion dlrs, were deliberately\nplaced out of reach of the Texas jury judgment.\n    But Richard Lieb, an attorney with Kronish, Lieb, Weiner\nand Hellman in New York, said Texaco could elect to place\nadditional subsidiaries into bankruptcy if necessary.\n    In the petition filed Sunday, only Texaco Inc, the\ncorporate parent, and two financial subsidiaries were included\nin the bankruptcy case. The businesses account for only about\nfour pct of Texaco's total revenues.\n    Mickey Sheinfeld, a Houston lawyer who represented\nContinental Airlines in an historic bankruptcy case that set\naside labor union agreements, said the track record of the\nbitter Texaco-Pennzoil struggle indicates that the two\ncompanies could spend two or three years fighting in bankruptcy\ncourt.\n    \"The courts have been very interested in the issue of\ngood-faith bankruptcy filings. This may prove to be a landmark\ncase in developing that issue,\" Sheinfeld said.\n    Texaco, he said, was following the example set by Manville\nCorp, A.H. Robins Co and other firms that fell into bankruptcy\nexpressly to avoid paying large legal judgments. Bankruptcy\nlaws were relaxed in 1978 so that a company no longer needed to\nprove it was insolvent in order to seek protection from\ncreditors.\n    Texaco lawyers bristle at the suggestion that the company\nentered bankruptcy to spite Pennzoil.\n    Gibson Gayle, a Texaco lawyer, said the company had every\nright to seek protection from creditors, and that Texaco had\nembarked on an internal restructuring plan in December 1984\nthat required transferring various assets among subsidiaries.\nBut Treece said the high profile of the Texaco bankruptcy case\nmay also put the company under an uncomfortable spotlight.\n    \"What seems fair and what may be legally correct may be two\nentirely different things,\" Treece said. \"This may be a signal\nto Congress to do something about tightening the bankruptcy\nlaws. You are either a chicken or a duck, just like you are\neither bankrupt or you're not.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"13-APR-1987 18:34:50.30","places":["usa"]},"16732":{"title":"LATEST BRITISH POLL HAS THATCHER STILL WAY AHEAD","body":"The latest British opinion poll gave\nMargaret Thatcher's Conservative party a huge 17 point lead\nover the opposition -- the highest rating yet for the prime\nminister who is seeking a record third consecutive term.\n    The poll in today's Sun popular tabloid showed the\nConservatives could win a solid majority of 125 seats in\nParliament in the next general election.\n    Thatcher must call an election by June 1988 but is widely\nexpected to call it this year.\n    The survey gave the Conservatives 44 pct of the votes,\nleft-wing Labour and the centrist Liberal-Social Democratic\nAlliance 27 pct each.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"13-APR-1987 18:48:56.49","places":["uk"]},"16733":{"title":"TEXACO <TX> PENNZOIL <PZL> WIDE APART ON ACCORD","body":"Texaco Inc and Pennzoil Co are still\nfar apart on a settlement of their 10.3 billion dlrs dispute,\nbut both sides are still willing to settle, executives from\nboth companies said.\n    Pennzoil chairman J.

Another, referring to the Philippine debt\nnegotiators, said \"The only reason they'd have to come back to\nNew York is political, not economic.\"\n    Ongpin has said as much himself, estimating that an extra\n1/16 percentage point would cost just 5.1 mln dlrs a year.\n    But the source close to the Philippines said Ongpin's anger\ngoes beyond the dollars. He said the minister feels personally\nbetrayed by bankers who insisted Mexico's 13/16 pct was a\nrock-bottom spread that could not be duplicated. Top U.S.\nTreasury and Federal Reserve officials had said the same.\n    The source said Ongpin is unlikely to come to the U.S. to\npress his case and was expecting the Philippines' bank advisory\ncommittee, headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, to\nnegotiate the spread reduction by telex.\n    Ongpin has not said the Philippines will unilaterally start\npaying interest at the lower rate but has made it clear to the\ncommittee in a telex that he is not prepared to pay more than\nMexico and Argentina, the source said.\n    \"The Philippines really means business on this. I don't\nthink there's much room for compromise,\" he said.\n    Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on the issue.\n    The Philippines last month won an agreement to reschedule\n10.3 billion dlrs of debt over 17 years at an interest rate of\n7/8 pct, whereas some 30 billion dlrs in old Argentine debt\nwill be stretched out over 19 years with a spread of 13/16 pct.\n    Bankers said they were forced to break their word because\npolitical circumstances had changed in the past few weeks.\n    In particular, they said it had become clear that Argentina\nwas serious about its threat to suspend interest payments\nunless it got a good deal. Fearing that an Argentine moratorium\nwould stiffen the resolve of its neighbour Brazil, which has\nalready suspended payments, the banks, at the urging of the\nReagan Administration, bowed to Argentina's demands.\n    Some U.S. bankers argued that, regardless of politics, the\nrich menu of options in the Argentine package makes it\nattractive enough to justify a 13/16 pct rescheduling rate.\n    \"When they (the Philippines) see the whole package, they\nmay realize that this is not a Mexican deal,\" one banker said\nof the Argentine agreement.\n    The Argentine pact contains several features that were not\nin the Mexican accord such as \"exit bonds,\" an option to\nprovide new money via bearer bonds, a trade facility, onlending\nprovisions and a debt-equity conversion scheme.\n    Moreover, Argentina is requesting only 1.95 billion dlrs in\nnew loans, compared with Mexico's 7.7 billion, and is paying\n7/8 pct for most of the money instead of the 13/16 pct charged\nto Mexico.\n    This line of argument cuts no ice with the Filipinos, who\nnote drily that they asked for no new money at all.\n    \"The banks reacted on the level of politics to Argentina\nand try to justify it in terms of economics, and now they're\ngoing to have problems with both the Philippines and\nVenezuela,\" said the source close to the Manila government.\n    Because of the Easter holidays bankers have not yet got an\nofficial reaction from Venezuela, which is also paying 7/8 pct\non its 20.2 billion dlr rescheduling. But they acknowledged\nthat Caracas, which was also told that the Mexico spread was\ninviolate, is quite likely to demand a lower spread.\n    Bankers were more sanguine in the case of Chile.\n    Because it is under fire for its human-rights record, the\ngovernment of General Augusto Pinochet is unlikely to attract\nattention to itself by seeking to renegotiate its recent debt\npackage, which carries interest of one pct, bankers said.\n    They hope that, once tempers cool, the Philippines will\nalso accept that reopening an agreement that took 4-1/2 tough\nmonths to negotiate will be more trouble than it is worth.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"17-APR-1987 15:23:17.46","places":["usa","philippines","argentina","brazil","mexico"]},"16905":{"title":"GULF AND WESTERN <GW> RESPONDS TO VALVE SUIT","body":"Gulf and Western Inc <GW> said it\nbelieves it has no liability under an earlier reported lawsuit\nseeking 500 mln dlrs in damages against it and two other\ncompanies.\n    The suit, filed by Niagara Mohawk Power Corp and other\nowners of the Nine Mile Point Two nuclear plant, concerns the\ndesign and fabrication of the ball valve system for the\nfacility.\n    \"Niagara Mohawk appears to be trying to shift their\nresponsibilities in connection with the construction of the\nNine Mile Point Two plant to others,\" Gulf and Western said.\n    Gulf and Western said it has not yet seen the lawsuit.\n    The company said a subsidiary no longer owned by it sold\nthe valves in question in 1977.
