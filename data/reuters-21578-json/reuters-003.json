While\nestimates vary, industry analysts project that providing\nproducts and services geared for information storage and\nretrieval could become a 20 billion dlr a year business by\n1995.\n    A wide range of technologies will be needed to meet the\nvarying requirements of users.\n    For example, a large credit verification service would want\na system from which it could quickly retrieve credit data and\nrelay it to its clients. A law firm, however, may need a\ncomputerized law library in which capacity, rather than speed,\nis the key feature. For architects and engineers, the ability\nto store photographs, sketches and other graphics would be\ncrucial.\n    Regardless of the specific application, the trend is toward\nconverting information - documents, video or film or even sound\nrecordings - into to the digital language of zeros and ones\nunderstood by computers.\n    Saving space is the key goal in digitizing data for\nstorage. An optical disk the size of a standard compact disk\ncan store 550 megabytes of data, or about 250,000 pages of\ntypewritten text.\n    For this reason, the compact disk read-only memory, or\nCD-ROM, is already a popular data storage media. Last week,\nMicrosoft introduced Microsoft Bookshelf, a 300 dlr program\nthat contains, on a single CD-ROM disk, a dictionary,\nthesaurus, national ZIP code directory, Bartlett's Familiar\nQuotations, the World Almanac and other reference works.\n    Scores of such products are already on the market, but most\nare specialty items, such as Lotus Development Corp's <LOTS>\nCD-ROM data base of stock information for financial analysts\nand investors. \"Microsoft Bookshelf is important because it\nmarks the arrival of CD-ROM packages for the general public,\"\nsaid Ian Warhaftig of International Data Corp.\n    One drawback of the CD-ROM, which uses a laser to record\nand read data, is that that it requires a special player.\nCD-ROM players for the retail market will appear later this\nyear.\n    Moreover, IDC's Warhaftig said CD-ROM's will be integrated\nwith personal computers.\n    \"Eventually, CD-ROM's will fit right inside the PC box,\" he\nsaid. \"Imagine the advantage of having a spelling checker and\nthesaurus at your fingertips when you're writing with a word\nprocessing program.\"\n    But CD-ROM's are just the beginning. Also last week, Kodak\nunveiled several systems that use 12-inch optical disks. The\nlargest Kodak system uses a jukebox-like cabinet to hold up to\n150 optical disks from which data can be retrieved in a matter\nof seconds.\n    Kodak also announced a 14-inch optical disk with 6.8\ngigabytes of memory, five times the memory of a CD-ROM. The\nKodak disk, which will not be available until the middle of\n1988, is designed for users who need quick access to very large\namounts of data, said Kodak's Giles.\n    Meanwhile, N.V. Philips <PGLO.AS>, the Dutch electronics\ngiant, is preparing to take optical disk technology a step\nfurther with the first disk that can combine text, video and\nsound. Philips said the system, called Called CD-Interactive,\nwill be ready next year. It will include a new kind of CD-ROM\nplayer that can hook up with a television set and stereo.\n     Additional breakthroughs are expected as the next\ngeneration of computer memory chips are introduced. Last month\nIBM said it has made a four-megabyte chip, capable of storing\nmore data than eight CD-ROM's. Meantime, <Nippon Telegraph and\nTelephone> of Japan said it has built a 16-megabyte chip.\n    Analysts say commercial versions of these chips are several\nyears away, though some suspect that IBM may start volume\nproduction of its four-megabyte chip sometime this year.\n    Such chips will enable computer makers to build computers\nwith immense memory capacities.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 9-MAR-1987 08:58:22.38","places":["usa"]},"3028":{"title":"BRAZIL SEAMEN CONTINUE STRIKE DESPITE COURT","body":"Hundreds of marines were on alert\nat 11 key Brazilian ports after 40,000 seamen decided to remain\non indefinite strike, even after the Higher Labour Court\nSaturday ruled it illegal, union leaders said.\n    The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years,\nstarted on February 27, and union leaders said they would not\nreturn to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise.

cut.\n    Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market\nas a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early\nrate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.\n    Most market participants believe that Lawson will now\nfoster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time\nof the budget, although one or two said they would not be\nsurprised to see a full point decline at this stage.\n    Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts\nlast week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued\na one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the\nGovernment bond market.\n    To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold\nout within hours of becoming available for trading and the\nmarket pushed on to register further sharp gains.\n    Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the\nissue announced today would be absorbed by the market as\nrapidly as last week's.\n    However, they noted that although sterling had edged down\nfrom its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed\non a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final\n71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5

The notes were priced\nlate Thursday by sole manager Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.\n    In a release, Standard and Poor's said the action reflected\na change in the note issue's terms to an unsecured form of debt\nfrom secured. That change was made after the agency rated the\nnotes on February 20, S and P stated.\n    \"We took action as we became aware that the issue's\nstructure had changed,\" said Robert Nelson of S and P. \"We\ngenerally make a distinction between secured and unsecured\ndebt, and this was the key factor in our downgrade.\"\n    A spokesman for Drexel said the action did not affect the\nHoliday Inns deal, which had already sold out to investors by\nlate Friday afternoon.\n    \"The Holiday notes are trading at 100.50 on a when-issued\nbasis,\" the Drexel spokesman said soon after S and P's\nannouncement. The 10-1/2 pct notes had been priced at par.\n    That is a far cry from late September, when S and P\ndowngraded a 215 mln dlr issue of subordinated sinking fund\ndebentures due 1998 of New World Pictures Ltd <NWP> just hours\nafter the pricing. Because of the rating cut to CCC-plus from\nB-minus, the underwriter halted sales and repriced the issue.\n    Sole manager L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin initially\ngave the debentures a 12-1/4 pct coupon and par pricing. It\nthen repriced the issue at 97 to yield 12.74 pct.\n    New World Pictures had increased the issue to 215 mln dlrs\nfrom an original offering of 150 mln dlrs, and that brought in\nS and P. The agency cited the larger financing in its action\nand said it believed the issuer's cash from existing operations\nwould not be enough to adequately service debt.\n    An officer with S and P said at the time the rating agency\nwas not told beforehand that the issue had been increased in\nsize. Usually, issuers and underwriters alert the rating\nagencies to any changes in debt offerings, he said.\n    In both cases, Moody's Investors Service Inc declined to\nfollow suit, bond traders noted.\n    Indeed, Moody's announced Friday that its original rating\nof B-1 for the Holiday Inns notes remained appropriate.\n    Moody's pointed out that while the seven-year notes would\nbe unsecured obligations of Holiday Inns, the issue would\nbenefit from a negative pledge provision and a call for\nspecified collateral under certain circumstances.\n    The agency also said the B-1 rating continued to recognize\na highly leveraged debt structure that would result from\nHoliday's recapitalization program, as well as the company's\ndependence on property sales to produce adequate cash flow for\nnear-term debt service.\n    \"Aside from Holiday Inns and New World Pictures, I cannot\nremember the last time an issue was downgraded so soon after\nthe pricing,\" remarked one corporate bond trader.\n    Holiday Inns also sold Thursday via Drexel 500 mln dlrs of\nsubordinated debentures due 1999 with an 11 pct coupon and par\npricing. The debentures' ratings of B-2 by Moody's and B-minus\nby S and P were left unchanged on Friday.\n    The combined offering of 1.4 billion dlrs was the\nsecond-largest junk bond deal ever brought to market,\nunderwriters and traders said. They said the biggest was BCI\nHoldings' 2.35 billion dlr offering on April 10, 1986.\n    That the Holiday Inns deal sold out quickly underscored the\nappetite of many investors for high-yield securities.\n    \"People are hungry for yield. They are not worried about\ndownside risk at all, especially for junk bonds issued by\nwell-known companies,\" said one portfolio manager.\n    As a result, investors are expected to snap up this week's\nplanned offerings by Allied Stores Corp of 200 mln dlrs of\nsenior notes due 1992, rated B-2/B, and 600 mln dlrs of senior\nsubordinated debentures due 1997, rated B-3/CCC-plus.\n    Lead underwriter First Boston Corp said Friday it has\ntentatively scheduled the securities for pricing today.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 9-MAR-1987 11:20:24.33","places":["usa"]},"3149":{"title":"TRADERS SAY USDA MAY LOWER ORANGE CROP ESTIMATE","body":"The U.S. Department of Agriculture will\nprobably decrease its estimate of the 1986/87 Florida orange\ncrop today to as low as 123 mln boxes from 129 mln boxes,\nanalysts and industry sources said.\n    The Department is scheduled to release the new estimate at\n1500 hrs EST (2100 gmt) today.\n    Analysts said the market is anticipating a downward\nrevision and much of the bullish impact has been discounted.\n    The estimate, which the USDA has left unchanged since\nOctober, should be affected this time by recent evidence of a\nshortfall in the early and midseason crop now that those\nharvests are complete.

This operation was coordinated with the Japanese\nmonetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and the\nU.S. Treasury.\n    The Fed's intervention was on the morning after president\nReagan's State of the Union message and was \"in a manner\nconsistent with the joint statement\" made by U.S. Treasury\nsecretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister Kiichi\nMiyazawa after their January 21 consultations.\n    At that meeting, the two reaffirmed their willingness to\ncooperate on exchange rate issues.\n    The Fed's report did not say at what level the intervention\noccurred.

decline in vegetable oil stocks\nthis year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseeds\nanalyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said.\n    Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta\nAgriculture's annual farm outlook conference that the world\nvegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies.\n    \"Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside\npotential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented\ndecline in the production of tree oils,\" Balletto said.\n    Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palm\nkernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mln\ntonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.\n    He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at\n33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearance\nat 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.\n    Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said,\ndisappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by\n600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.\n    \"If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting the\ncrush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in\nthe edible oils sector could develop,\" he said.\n    \"This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high\noil yielding seeds,\" Balletto said.\n    Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed prices\nbecause of burdensome supplies, he said.\n    World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase\nfor the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes,\ncompared with 25.4 mln last year.\n    The increase should result from lower disappearance, as\nproduction is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7\nmln last year, he said.\n    World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mln\ntonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said,\nwhile production of other oilseeds was lower.\n    Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made\nup for lower production in the United States, he said.\n    Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S.\nstocks make up most of those, Balletto said.\n    The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes,\nabout half of the world soybean surplus, he said.\n    Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased\n13.1 mln tonnes.\n    \"During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1\nmln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire world\nsurplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially\nhigh prices caused by the U.S. loan program.\"\n    \"Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseeds\nprices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as long\nas the U.S. soybean surplus continues.\n    For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in a\nrange tied to the U.S. loan program.\n    \"Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply\noverhang while strong underlying support is provided by the\nU.S. loan rate.\"\n    The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially\nhigh prices encourage producers in South America, Canada and\nAustralia to shift from grains to oilseeds,

A spokesman said\nthe suspension was just a reaction to yields on national\nsavings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the\nmarket.\n    The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutes\ntoday of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, the\nsecond such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted.\n    They said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts\nissue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct\ndownpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rates\nhad to drop sooner rather than later.\n    The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due\n1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward\npressure on money market rates remained intact, with the\nbellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at\n10-9-7/8 pct.\n     It coincided with another strong sterling rally which\npushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar.\n    \"That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed,\" said\nStephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokers\nPhillips and Drew; \"It is an indication that the market believes\nrates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-point\nimmediately after the budget (on March 17), and some people\nhope for more.\"\n    Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the\nNational Savings Department was \"of considerable significance.\"\n    It said, \"the real message ... Is that the decks are being\nquickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the\nbuilding societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut\nin bank base rates to 10 pct materialises.\"\n    Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates\nwould normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a\nreduction in mortgage lending rates.\n    Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the\nNational Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury\npolicy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut.\n    \"National Savings has been competing too effectively with\nthe building societies of late. Building society income has\nbeen depressed in recent months,\" he said.\n    He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer\nNigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid\non U.K. Inflation.\n    Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain\nthan in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising\nwell above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after\nlast year's 3.7 pct.\n    Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer\nprices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rates\nwould reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct.\n    But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been\ncomplaining to the government about intense competition from\nNational Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early\nmortgage rate cuts.\n    \"The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR\nfunding from National Savings, but he must be taking the\nbuilding societies' criticism to heart. It looks like the\nNational Savings move reflects this,\" one senior dealer said.\n    A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this\ninterpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely a\nreaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which had\npushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with\nthe rest of the market.\n    \"We are not politically motivated ... Funding was just\nbecoming too expensive and we don't need all that money,\" he\ntold Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues at\nleast twice in the past, when offered interest rates were above\nor below market rates.\n    He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as\nU.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline and\nincome was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion\nstg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31.\n    In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving's\ncontribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg,\ncompared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of the\nprevious year, official figures show.\n    Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show a\nfurther increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing the\ntotal for 11 months above target, government officials said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"11-MAR-1987 12:21:35.59","topics":["interest"],"places":["uk"]},"3763":{"title":"NICOR INC <GAS> REGULAR DIVIDEND SET","body":"Qtly div 45 cts vs 45 cts previously\n    Pay May 1\n    Record March 31\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"11-MAR-1987 12:22:59.47","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"3764":{"title":"HANDLEMAN CO <HDL> SETS QUARTERLY","body":"Qtly div 14 cts vs 14 cts prior\n    Pay April 10\n    Record March 27\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"11-MAR-1987 12:28:01.76","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"3765":{"title":"PERINI CORP <PCR> SETS QUARTERLY","body":"Qtly div 20 cts vs 20 cts prior\n    Pay June 16\n    Record May 22\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"11-MAR-1987 12:28:06.12","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"3766":{"title":"JONES AND VINING SAID VULCAN CORP OFFERS FIVE DLRS A SHARE FOR JONES\n","date":"11-MAR-1987 12:30:45.74","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"3767":{"title":"FMHA COULD LOSE SEVEN BILLION DLRS IN LOANS","body":"The Farmers Home Administration, the\nU.S. Agriculture Department's farm lending arm, could lose\nabout seven billion dlrs in outstanding principal on its\nseverely delinquent borrowers, or about one-fourth of its farm\nloan portfolio, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said.\n    In remarks prepared for delivery to the Senate Agriculture\nCommittee, Brian Crowley, senior associate director of GAO,\nalso said that a preliminary analysis of proposed changes in\nFmHA's financial eligibility standards indicated as many as one\nhalf of FmHA borrowers who received new loans from the agency\nin 1986 would be ineligible under the proposed system.\n    The agency has proposed evaluating applicants' credit using\na variety of financial ratios instead of relying solely on\ncashflow ability.\n    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)\nslammed the proposed eligibility changes, telling FmHA\nAdministrator Vance Clark at a hearing that they would mark a\n\"dramatic shift\" in the agency's purpose away from being farmers'\nlender of last resort toward becoming a \"big city bank.\"\n    But Clark defended the new regulations, saying the agency\nhad a responsibility to administer its 70-billion dlr loan\nportfolio in a \"compassionate yet judicious manner.\"\n    Crowley of GAO, Congress' investigative arm, said the\nproposed credit scoring system attempted to ensure that FmHA\nwould make loans only to borrowers who had a reasonable change\nof repaying their debt.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"11-MAR-1987 12:32:31.97","places":["usa"]},"3768":{"title":"INTERNATIONAL BANKNOTE CO INC <IBK> 4TH QTR LOSS","body":"Oper shr loss 11 cts vs loss 14 cts\n    Oper net loss 1,963,000 vs loss 2,199,000\n    Revs 17.5 mln vs 40.9 mln\n    Year\n    Oper shr profit nine cts vs profit two cts\n    Oper net profit 1,555,000 vs 456,000\n    Revs 86.3 mln vs 143.7 mln\n    NOTE: Net excludes extraordinary tax charges of 115,000\ndlrs vs 995,000 dlrs in quarter and credits 8,096,000 dlrs vs\n1,173,000 dlrs in year.\n    1985 year net includes pretax gain 7,400,000 dlrs from\ntermination of pension plan.\n    1985 net includes pretax charge 1,200,000 dlrs in quarter\nand gain 1,400,000 dlrs in year from restructuring and\nconsolidation.\n    1985 quarter net includes 1,480,000 dlr tax credit.\n    1986 year net includes pretax gain 17.2 mln dlrs from sale\nof foreign subsidiary.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"11-MAR-1987 12:33:12.91","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"3769":{"title":"NYSE SAYS GENERAL REFRACTORIES <GRX> NO COMMENT","body":"The New York Stock Exchange said\nGeneral Refractories Co had no comment on the activity in its\nstock.\n    The company's shares were trading off 1-1/2 at 15-1/4.\n    The exchange said it contacted the company and asked if\nthere were any corporate developments to explain the unusual\nactivity.

All\nbuyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a\nbarrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for\nacquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five\ndlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research.\n    \"Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but\nwe're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in,\" said\nArthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and\npresident of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn.\n    \"Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and\ngas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,\" he added.\n    Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe\nthe trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because\nof the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that\noil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to\nbuy new reserves than to explore for them.\n    Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to\nthe need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and\ngeneral restructuring throughout the oilpatch.\n    In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,\nFrench-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of <Total Compagnie\nFrancaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to\nseparately acquire oil assets of Texas International <TEICC>\nand Lear Petroleum Partners <LPP>. A spokesman for Minatome\nsaid the company is searching for additional acquisitions.\n    A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, <Petrofina S.A.>\nand <Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy\nvirtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos <WMB>,\nthe Oklahoma pipeline firm.\n    But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures\nwith experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's\n<Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's <TX> Texaco USA in a\n100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with\nDupont's <DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal.\n    Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its\ngeographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are\nmore important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions\nthan relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula.\n    Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing\nInternational Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of <Preussag\nCorp> and <C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had\nearmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in\nTexas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.\n    But he called that a small amount compared to the amount\nother investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's Geodyne\nEnergy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up\nto 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties.\n    \"The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign\ninvestors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil\ncompanies,\" he said. \"Our company is shopping around because we\nfeel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. If\nyou're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need\nprices higher than the current market,\" he added.\n    In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage\nhouses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also\ncompeting for prime properties.\n    Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group\n<RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and\nselling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired\ntwo billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of\noil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said.\n    \"Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these\ncompanies,\" Smith said. \"Domestic production has dropped by one\nmln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may\ndrop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"11-MAR-1987 13:11:35.31","topics":["crude","nat-gas"],"places":["usa"]},"3799":{"title":"CBT BOARD OF DIRECTORS POSTPONES LAUNCH  OF NIGHT TRADING UNTIL APRIL 30, EXCHANGE SAYS\n","date":"11-MAR-1987 13:12:56.56"},"3800":{"title":"AUSTRIAN 1987 GROWTH SEEN BETWEEN 0.5 AND 1.5 PCT","body":"A meeting of leading politicians,\nbankers and economists has forecast Austrian real gross\ndomestic product growth for this year at between 0.5 and 1.5\npct, a government spokesman said.\n    This compared with a two pct growth forecast made by the\nsemi-official Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) last\nDecember.\n    Helmut Kramer, spokesman for Chancellor Franz Vranitzky,\ntold Reuters that the forecast had been made during the meeting\nattended by Vranitzky, Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina,\nNational Bank President Stefan Koren and a WIFO representative.\n    Economists have been cutting growth forecasts recently\nmainly due to expectations of a poor export performance this\nyear, notably to Eastern Europe and oil exporting states.\n    Hannes Androsch, general director of\nCreditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI>, today put 1987 GDP growth\nat between one and 1.5 pct.\n    Kramer also said the meeting had heard that unemployment\nfor the year would be above the 5.5 pct forecast, but was\nunlikely to be more than six pct.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"11-MAR-1987 13:13:45.38","topics":["gnp"],"places":["austria"]},"3801":{"title":"<FOR BETTER LIVING INC> 4TH QTR NET","body":"Shr profit primary 91 cts vs loss 86 cts\n    Shr profit diluted 90 cts vs loss 86 cts\n    Net profit 787,000 vs loss 751,000\n    Sales 20 mln vs 12.5 mln\n    Year\n    Shr profit profit 2.63 dlrs vs profit five cts\n    Shr profit diluted 2.59 dlrs vs profit five cts\n    Net profit 2,273,000 vs profit 43,000\n    Sales 70.1 mln vs 47.1 mln\n    Note: Prior qtr and year figures include gains on disposal\nof discontinued operations of 76,000 dlrs and 79,000 dlrs,\nrespectively.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"11-MAR-1987 13:15:23.01","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"3802":{"title":"DIMIS <DMISC> EXTENDS WARRANT EXPIRATION","body":"Dimis Inc said it has extended\nthe expiration of its 1,424,500 common stock purchase warrants\nto September 30 from March 31.\n    Each two warrants allow the purchase of one share at two\ndlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"11-MAR-1987 13:15:42.88","places":["usa"]},"3803":{"title":"PRUDENTIAL TO FORM REAL ESTATE BROKERAGE UNIT","body":"<Prudential Insurance Co of\nAmerica> said it will enter the real estate brokerage business\nin 1988 and plans to develop a national network of franchised\nbrokerage offices.\n    Prudential said its new real estate unit, Prudential Real\nEstate Affiliates, will be headed by Jerome M.
