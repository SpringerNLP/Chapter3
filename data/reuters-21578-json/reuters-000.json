He said a mill in Matane, a depressed\narea with high unemployment, would be heavily subsidized by the\ngovernment.\n    Peladeau said he is interested in further joint ventures\nwith Maxwell's company, either in the newspaper market in\nFrance or in the U.S., where the company owns two large\nprinting plants and is looking to expand its newspaper empire.\n    He said Maxwell's sons, who are French citizens, would\nprovide an entree into the French market, where foreigners are\nprevented from buying newspapers. Peladeau said he would\nconsider either buying into or starting daily newspapers in\nFrance or the U.S.\n    Quebecor is also in the process of expanding its chain of\nabout 40 weekly newspapers, with the possible acquisition of\ntwo groups of weekly newspapers in the U.S., and is negotiating\nthe acquisition of two weekly newspaper chains in Canada,\nPeladeau said.\n    He said the company may consider starting daily newspapers\nin two small Quebec cities and buying radio stations in the\nprovince.\n    Peladeau said Quebecor may also consider trading in its\nlisting on the American stock exchange for a New York Stock\nExchange listing.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"26-FEB-1987 16:18:41.47","places":["canada"]},"80":{"title":"NEW YORK BUSINESS LOANS FALL 195 MLN DLRS","body":"Commercial and industrial loans on the\nbooks of the 10 major New York banks, excluding acceptances,\nfell 195 mln dlrs to 65.06 billion in the week ended February\n18, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said.\n    Including acceptances, loans declined 114 mln dlrs to 65.89\nbillion.\n    Commercial paper outstanding nationally dropped 375 mln\ndlrs to 336.63 billion.\n    National business loan data are scheduled to be released on\nFriday.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"26-FEB-1987 16:20:06.60","topics":["money-supply"],"places":["usa"]},"81":{"title":"N.Y.

The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial\nservices firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.\n    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at\n72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.\n    American Express would not comment on the rumors or its\nstock activity.\n    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'\nmeeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement\nyesterday of management changes.\n    At the meeting, company officials said American Express\nstock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance\nof Shearson, according to analysts.\n    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief\noperating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of\npresident, which had been vacant. It also created four new\npositions for chairmen of its operating divisions.\n    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most\nsense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total\nspinoff.\n    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of\nShearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for\nAmerican Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last\nyear.\n    \"I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is\ngoing to sell shearson,\" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.\nHe questioned what would be a better investment than \"a very\nprofitable securities firm.\"\n    Several analysts said American Express is not in need of\ncash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong\nasset.\n    But others believe the company could very well of\nconsidered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one\nrumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.\n    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he\nbelieves American Express could have considered a partial\nspinoff in the past.\n    \"Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a\nbig premium in the market place.

France and Hong Kong, fund managers said.\n    After concentrating on U.S. Treasury bonds for years,\nJapanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on\nsimilar types of investments, they said.\n    Japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may\ndouble or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in\n1986, Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd, said.\n    Matsumoto, who manages Nikko's investment research and\nstrategy, said there is evidence Japanese investors began\npoking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year,\nbut few made firm commitments until December when net purchases\nsuddenly grew to 1.5 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each\nof the previous five months.\n    Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs, he added.\n    This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw\nthe widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pct\nof funds will be invested in the U.S. Markets, Matsumoto said.\n    \"The trend has been to head toward the U.S. Market, first\nbecause of its size and next because it has been successful\nover the last couple of years,\" said Eugene Atkinson, managing\ndirector of Goldman Sachs International Corp.\n    Wall Street's massive turnover offers good liquidity,\nenabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in\nand out of shares with the minimum of risk, he added.\n    However, few see holdings in U.S. Treasuries dwindling.\nThey will remain a Japanese mainstay, fund managers said.\n    Institutions, particularly life insurance companies which\nconcentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover\npayouts to policy holders, are unlikely to sell their U.S.\nTreasuries, but will put in less money, said Shinichi Kobuse,\nmanager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's international fixed\nincome activities.\n    There has been some selling of U.S. Bonds by short-term\ninvestors, but the selling is unlikely to amount to a\nsignificant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because the\nliquidity of the U.S. Bond market remains attractive, he added.\n    Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the U.S.\nEquity markets despite predictions by economists the U.S.\nEconomy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months.\n    Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reports\nof significant growth in earnings by major U.S. Corporations,\nhe added.\n    Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life Insurance\nCo told an economic conference that insurance companies, which\nare responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreign\nsecurities, hold a lopsided proportion of U.S. Treasuries and\nintend to diversify into other instruments and currencies.\n    Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their\nfunds into the U.S., But will now invest in Britain, West\nGermany, France and other countries, Hashimoto said.\n    Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks\nrelatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the\nstrength in the yen, the growth in stock values is expected to\noffset currency risks, he added.\n    One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct\nannual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in\nU.S. 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund\ninvestment stategies.\n    The bank is looking more at U.S. Equities and European\nbonds, he said.\n    Japanese investments in British equities have already\nturned active and the pace is likely to increase, said Andrew\nSheaf, general manager of international equity activities at\nCounty Securities Japan.\n    \"Last week was the busiest week we had,\" he said.\n    Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of\nBritish companies and the recent deregulation of government\ncontrolled firms, fund managers said.\n    Deregulation in France is also attracting Japanese\ninterest, but stock investments there will be inhibited by\nworries about the French franc, they said.\n    Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term and\nspeculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term\npolitical stability, they added.\n    Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany,\nparticularly as German firms, like their Japanese counterparts,\nare concerned about the recent dollar fall.\n    Australia also

domestic product (gdp) had been revised.\n    But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this\nfinancial year and net export growth will provide the total\nsource of gdp growth.\n    The August budget had forecast domestic demand would\ncontribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5\npct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.\n    Keating said the overall

marked slowing in\ninflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary\neffects wane,\" he said.\n    Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick\nup moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in\nnet exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from\nprivate domestic demand.\n    He said domestic demand growth will be due to a\nstrengthening in real

If we\nare not hard then we will not be successful.\"\n    Boesze said the budget could also make savings from reserve\nprovisions of two billion forints for central expenditure and\n800 mln forints for transfers to local authorities. \"I believe\nthese reserves should not be used at all,\" he said.\n    Wage growth last year outstripped that of gross domestic\nproduct, which expanded one pct instead of a planned 2.5 pct.\n    The authorities had already signalled a small fall in real\nwages for 1987, but Boesze said firms will suffer severe tax\npenalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct.\n    This would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retail\nprice inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986.\n    A four-month basic wage freeze expires on April 1.\n    About 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and\n33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices.\n    Boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant\ncuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations made\nthis difficult.\n    But he added: \"I think ultimately we will be able to make\ncurtailments in subsidies in this area as well.\"\n    He said Hungary plans to introduce price reform at the\nbeginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and\nvalue added tax. The IMF supports these aims.\n    Hungary introduced a bankrupcty law last September in an\nattempt to shake out surplus labour from inefficient firms.\n    Between 100,000 and 150,000 workers are expected to be\nunemployed at least temporarily by 1990. Labour discipline is\nbeing tightened and firms may fire workers more easily.\n    Boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state\nby firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to\nshed labour. He gave no exact figures.\n    Istvan Nagy, a senior Finance Ministry official responsible\nfor drafting the bankrupcy law, told Reuters last year he hoped\nthe law would cut state subsidies to enterprises by 50 pct.\n    After subsidies to state enterprises, the largest single\nbudget items are social insurance (153 billion forints approved\nfor 1987) and transfers to local councils (80 billion).\n    Interest payments on international debt are set to rise to\nmore than 10 billion forints in 1987 from between six and seven\nbillion in 1986, Boesze said.\n    Hungary's net hard currency debt leapt by 54 pct last year\nto 7.7 billion dlrs, according to provisional figures, while\ntrade with Western countries plunged into a deficit of more\nthan 400 mln dlrs from a 1.2 billion dlr surplus just two years\nearlier.\n    Boesze said last year's budget deficit was financed 90 pct\nby credits from the National Bank, mostly from abroad, and 10\npct by the issue of domestic state bonds.\n    Deputy Prime Minister Frigyes Berecz told Hungarian\neconomists in a speech this month that the country's economy\nwas in a \"very difficult\" situation, but not in crisis.\n    There would have to be a turnround with tangible results\nthis year, however, and borrowing must be used more\neffectively.\n    \"Any rise in our present loans may prove to be dangerous,\"\nBerecz said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 2-MAR-1987 07:11:48.84","organisations":["imf"],"places":["hungary"]},"336":{"title":"U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST REVISED DOWN","body":"The Bank of England said it revised its\nforecast of the shortage in the money market down to around 700\nmln stg from its original estimate of 800 mln.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 2-MAR-1987 07:18:18.32","topics":["money-fx","interest"],"places":["uk"]},"337":{"title":"ALASKA HOUSING HAS 150 MLN DLR SYNDICATED LOAN","body":"Alaska Housing Finance Corp, a local U.S.\nGovernment agency, has become the first municipal entity to tap\nthe syndicated loan market, receiving a 150 mln dlr, seven-year\nrevolving loan, said Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as arranger.\n    Merrill said the loan is a back-up to a proposed\neuro-commercial paper program.\n    The syndicated loan, which is unsecured, carries a\ncommitment fee of 0.10 pct per year.

That was another\nstory about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a dark\nroom.\"\n    Spaventa, in tune with other economists and industrialists\nhere, stress Italy's recent achievements, particularly the\ndramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial\nenterprises, but warns that the economy is still vulnerable.\n     Profits of private sector firms such as Fiat S.P.A.,\n<FIAT.M> and <ING. C. Olivetti and C. S.P.A.> are booming, the\nmajor state industries are back in the black after years of\nlosses, inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of\npayments deficits have been slashed. Expectations by some\nexperts that Italy is poised to replace Britain as the world's\nfifth largest economy have also boosted optimism.\n    Italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it\nfeels to be its second-rate status among the major\nindustrialised countries.\n    Only this week, it angrily demanded clarification of this\nstatus after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers\nfrom the Group of Five (G-5) - comprising the United States,\nJapan, West Germany, France and Britain.\n    Italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an\nagreement reached in Tokyo last year to let Italy and Canada\nattend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned\nmanaging the international monetary system.\n    But Italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems\nstill facing its economy, economists and industrialists say.\n    \"We must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy,\"\nwarns Fiat managing director Cesare Romiti.\n    He says that while Italy's recent achievements are indeed\ncause for satisfaction and optimism, the focus now should be on\nthe problems still remaining rather than those already solved.\n    The country's huge state sector deficit, high unemployment\nand a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most\nworrying problems, experts say.\n    The size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at\n109,561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100,000 billion\nlire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiral\nagain, says Carlo Scognamiglio, head of the private Luiss\nuniversity in Rome.\n    Inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a\ndecade in September 1984 and by January this year was running\nat 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guarantee\ninternational competiveness, economists and industrialists say.\n    And unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally last\nOctober according to the latest official data.\n    Recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 million\npeople seeking work in October 1986, almost 73 pct were aged\nbetween 14 and 29. Unemployment in the south was running at\n17.7 pct, more than double that in the industrial north.\n    The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD) recently forecast that Italian gross domestic product\n(GDP) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pct\nin 1986. But it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to\ncheck rising unemployment.\n    Another problem is Italy's reliance on imported raw\nmaterials. The country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs.\n    This factor actually worked sharply in Italy's favour last\nyear, when lower energy costs helped slash the country's trade\ndeficit to 3,717 billion lire  by year end from 23,085 billion\nlire in 1985.\n    But economists say the improvement owes little to any\nstructural change in the Italian economy and that any reversal\nof the trend in costs could have serious consequences.\n    If Italy truly wants to be counted among the world's top\nindustrialised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarket\noperating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality\ninformation about their activities, economists say.\n    Italy has no controls on insider trading.\n    The country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements\ncontrols -- a European Community directive calls for these to\nbe dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a less\nblinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating\nprocedures, economists say.\n    \"Even today, if I wanted to invest in the Tokyo bourse, I\ndoubt I'd find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in banks\nwhich would allow me to do that,\" says Spaventa.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 2-MAR-1987 07:20:20.88","places":["italy"]},"341":{"title":"U.K. MONEY MARKET RECEIVES 37 MLN STG ASSISTANCE","body":"The Bank of England said it had provided\nthe money market with 37 mln stg assistance in the morning\nsession.

Reserves were reported to have\ndropped below four billion dlrs.\n    Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems\nwith Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only\npartial servicing of the debt.\n    \"What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance\nfor part of the service, because we cannot service all that,\" he\nsaid. \"I really think we have to change the old rules.\"\n    Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments, rather\nthan the commercial banks themselves in its search for a\nsolution to the crisis, Funaro said \"We must first talk to the\ngovernments and then we can talk to the banks, because the\nbanks have some limits.\"\n    \"It is a political discussion from our point of view,\" he\nsaid.\n    Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to\nJapanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talk\nto the commercial banks \"If I've got some solution from the\ngovernments. I can't take the burden only to the banks.\" He was\nnot sure how long it would take to reach a solution.\n   In discussions with governments Brazil would review the\nmechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in\nneed. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually\nclosed since 1982. \"You must open these mechanisms,\" he said.\n    He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed by\nBrazil's suspension of interest payments, they understood\nBrazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves.\n    Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed \"because\nwe can't stay as we were the last few years.\"\n    \"I'm trying to put the problem on the table.... All of us\nwould like to have a kind of equilibrium.\" he said. Although\nBrazil has rejected a substantive role for the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy, Funaro paid a call\nin Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and to\nWorld Bank President Barber Conable.\n    Funaro noted that inflation in February had started to\ndecline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eight\nbillion dlr trade surplus in 1987.\n    Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus had\ndeclined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last\nyear, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months.\n    Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world,\nFunaro said, although its share of international trade was only\none pct.  \"The solution is linked with growth, not recession,\" he\nsaid, noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports and\ninducing an internal recession in order to service debt.\n    Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments,\nas opposed to commercial banks, now benefit from a sounder\nstructure following last month's rescheduling by the Paris Club\nof creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 2-MAR-1987 09:43:38.51","organisations":["imf","worldbank"],"places":["uk","brazil","usa","japan"]},"420":{"title":"WHITTAKER CORP <WKR> 1ST QTR JAN 31 NET","body":"Oper shr 17 cts vs 25 cts\n    Qtly div 15 cts vs 15 cts prior\n    Oper net 1,522,000 vs 3,501,000\n    Sales 98.0 mln vs 86.3 mln\n    NOTE: Prior year net excludes loss from discontinued\noperations of 1,817,000 dlrs.\n    Company said common shares outstanding down significantly\nto 7,814,000, reflecting retirement of about 5,200,000 shares\nsince start of restructurining in August 1986.\n    Dividend pay April 30, record April 16.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 2-MAR-1987 09:43:47.96","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"421":{"title":"QUEBEC'S CAISSE DES JARDINS ISSUES YEN EUROBOND","body":"Caisse Centrale Desjardins du Quebec is\nissuing a 10 billion yen step-up eurobond maturing on March 25,\n1992 and priced at 101-3/4 pct, joint-bookrunner Warburg\nSecurities said.\n    The issues pays a coupon of one pct in years one and two\nand then pays a coupon of 7-7/8 pct in years three, four and\nfive.

controversial plan\nfor the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be\nforced reluctantly to accept.\n    Under the plan steel output would remain subject to\nrestrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for\nyears to come while steel firms undertook a massive\nslimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand.\n    Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the\nending of the quota system by December 1988.\n    He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC\nlaw is supposed to exist except in times of \"manifest crisis.\"\n    But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this\nidea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in\ntheir countries, with orders falling as customers switch to\nalternative products and accounts firmly in the red.\n    Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are\nlikely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the\nindustry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the\npolitical impact of plant closures, they said.\n    Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the\nEC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota\nproduction system at least until the end of 1990.\n    Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it\nidentified scope for closing plants on a \"voluntary\" basis to\nreduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year.\n    Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that\nof hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed.\n    Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the\nCommission

S/P TRADING","body":"Directors of the Chicago Mercantile\nExchange will meet Wednesday to consider a membership petition\nasking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading\nactivities in the widely-popular Standard and Poor's 500 Stock\nIndex futures pit, an exchange executive said.\n    The petition calls for elimination of dual trading, a legal\npractice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade\nfor their own account.\n    But exchange officials noted this practice also provides an\nopportunity for a trader to engage in what is called\n\"front-running\", where traders enter orders for their own account\nbefore executing orders for their customers.\n    Leo Melamed, CME special counsel, said directors will rule\non the petition on Wednesday, but added that a special S and P\nAdvisory Committee has been studying S and P 500 futures\ntrading conditions for the last six months and is expected to\nsubmit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days.\n    In addition to a recommendation on dual trading, Melamed\nsaid the special committee will also make suggestions about a\npossible automatic order entry and execution system for S and P\n500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that would\nalleviate congested conditions in the trading pit.\n    Melamed said directors are likely to approve the\nrecommendations of the special committee because \"most actions\nof the board are in line with committee recommendations.\"\n    CME senior vice president Gerald Beyer said if the board\naccepts the member's petition this week, a rule change will be\nsubmitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for\napproval.\n    If the board does nothing, or rejects the petition request,\na rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership\nfor a vote within 15 days, Beyer said.\n    Melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on\nbefore the recommendations from the special committee are made\n\"it will confuse the issue.\"\n    Not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict\ndual trading.\n    Although Jonathan Wolff, senior vice president at Donaldson\nLufkin and Jenrette, noted dual trading is evident on most\nexchanges.\n    \"It's a question of the integrity of the person you do\nbusiness with,\" Wolff said.\n    Futures traders who act as brokers, however, maintain that\ntrading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up\nfor errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in\nchaotic futures trading pits.\n    \"To have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult\nfor a broker to function because of his errors,\" said John\nMichael, vice president at First Options of Chicago.\n    \"What it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved,\"\nhe said.\n    Furthermore, the competitive nature of futures brokerage\nmakes front-running risky to a broker's livelihood, he said.\n    \"If I ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running), or\neven suspected him of doing it, I would cut him off,\" Michael\nsaid.\n    An average broker in the Treasury bond futures pit, for\ninstance, will fill orders for 5,000 to 10,000 contracts a day\nat 1.25 dlrs per contract, floor sources said.

By 1990, however,\ncustomized chips are expected to represent a 12 billion to 15\nbillion dlr market, about 25 pct of total chip sales.\n    More important for their vendors, because they are not a\nstandard design customized chips represent a sellers' market,\nand prices and profit margins can be set accordingly.\n    High volume memory chips have become \"a perfect commodity\nmarket,\" Robert Brodersen, a professor of electrical\nengineering at the University of California at Berkeley, told\nan industry forum.\n    \"The product is interchangeable between one manufacturer\nand another and customers base their buying decisions almost\nentirely on price,\" Brodersen said. \n    He predicted that, in the next few years, only a handful of\nthe world's largest chip manufacturers (most of them Japanese)\nwill produce memory chips, the standard electronic component\nfound in everything from digital watches to computers. \"The\nrest of the industry just won't be involved.\"\n    Last week's International Solid State Circuits Conference,\nthe chip industry's annual forum for new developments, seemed\nto support Brodersen's prediction.\n     Of the 116 papers presented at the conference, some 40 pct\nhad Japanese authors, the first time they have outnumberd the\nUnited States. Most of the Japanese chip designs were in the\nmemory category, including Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Co's\nattention-grabbing 16 mln bit dynamic random access memory\n(dram) chip, 16 times more powerful than anything now\navailable.\n    The most advanced memory chip described by a U.S. company\nwas International Business Machine Corp's <IBM> four mln bit\nchip, and IBM only manufactures chips for its own internal use,\nnot for the open market.\n    The problem with memory chips is that they are all based on\nthe same, well known design standards, so they are easy to copy\nand inexpensive to manufacture. Because such large Japanese\nconglomerates as Sony Corp <SNE>, NEC Corp, <NIPNY> Matushita\nand Mitsui have their own enormous consumer and electronics\nproduct lines, they also have a guaranteeed internal market for\ntheir chips, so they can produce huge amounts at a very low\ncost per unit.\n    Customized chips, however, are designed for a specific\ncustomer, manufactured in small quantities and expensive\nrelative to standard chips. Computer markets are increasingly\nlooking to customized chips because they are difficult to copy,\nthus making the final product harder to clone as well.\n    Intel Corp <INTC>, the leading manufacturer of the\nmicroprocessors that form the brains of most computers, alerted\nthe industry to its intention to switch to customized chips\nlast fall.\n    The company, which just reported a loss for 1986, said it\nwill spend 75 mln dlrs over the next three years to turn itself\ninto a leading manufacturer of custom and semi-custom chips.\n    Intel joins some 275 companies already competing for a\npiece of the customized chip business but it has an advantage\nthat the others do not. IBM, which owns a 20 pct stake in\nIntel, has agreed to share the designs for many of the 15,000\nchips it makes for its own use. Intel will customize those\ndesigns and sell them to others.\n    It will also get to use IBM's proprietary computer system\nfor designing chips, considered by experts to be one of the\nmost advanced in the world.\n    Intel's success is still not guaranteed, however. Industry\nanalysts noted that it is far different to design a mass market\nitem than a customized chip that requires a close working\nrelationship with the customer.\n    Intel spent five years and 100 mln dlrs developing its\nnewest 30386 microprocessor.

regulators and investors\nwithin the next 18 months, making their direct-dealing screens\navailable to many of those firms that are not now eligible to\nreceive them, said Richard Lacy, Chairman of Exco International\nInc.\n    Earlier today, Exco said it purchased an 80 pct interest in\nRMJ Holdings Corp, one of the largest of the four bond brokers\nthat dominate the business.\n    In a telephone interview, Lacy said \"Within 18 months, we\nthink the number of players will be expanded.\"\n    Currently, the four major brokers will sell their\ndirect-dealing screens to only primary dealers in U.S.\nGovernment securities or those that have applied to the Federal\nReserve Bank of New york to become a primary dealer.\n    The U.S. Justice department is looking into whether\nlimiting access to the screens to just a small group of dealers\nis a violation of U.S. Anti-trust laws.\n    Primary dealers, of which there are now 40, are an elite\ngroup of firms approved to buy Treasury securities directly\nfrom the Fed.\n    But Lacy said that any agreement to expand access to the\nbrokers' direct-dealing screens is likely to be not as\nfar-reaching as some would like. Instead of making screens\navailable to any firm willing to pay for one, he said, it is\nmore likely that a \"second tier\" will be established.\n    He also said that RMJ is not willing to break away from the\ngroup of bond brokers and be the only firm to make its screens\nwidely available to any one who wants them.\n    Bond market sources had speculated that RMJ is better\nprepared to offer its services nationwide than its three major\ncompetitors.\n    Lacy also said that he does not see any immediate pressure\nfor a further cut in commissions paid on bond transactions any\ntime soon. In late 1985, transaction fees paid to brokers were\ncut in half to 39 dlrs per mln dlr transaction from 78 dlrs.\n    Some U.S. primary bond dealers have been suggesting that\nwith further increases in transaction volume, fees can be cut\nwithout hurting the brokers' profits.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 2-MAR-1987 14:09:40.87"},"672":{"title":"EC MINISTERS STRUGGLE TO AGREE ON DAIRY CUTS","body":"European Community, EC, agriculture\nministers struggled today to finalise new rules aimed at\nlimiting sales into public cold stores of unwanted butter at\nhigh guaranteed EC prices, diplomats said.\n    The plan is the key element in a landmark accord to cut\ndairy output by 9.5 pct over two years agreed in outline last\nDecember after virtually nine days of non-stop negotiations.\n    The accord, which is due to operate from the start of the\nnew milk marketing year on April 1, was hailed as the most\nsignificant step in an on-going campaign to reform costly EC\nfarm policies and cut embarrassing food surpluses.\n    Diplomats say the December agreement itself is not\nthreatened but that its effect could be considerably weakened\nif the proposals are altered too radically.\n    West Germany and Ireland are opposed to proposed limits on\na farmer's now automatic right to sell surplus butter into\npublic stores when market prices and stocks are high.\n    Faced with a butter \"mountain\" of a record 1.2 mln tonnes\ncosting over two mln dlrs per day just to store, EC farm\nCommissioner Frans Andriessen says farmers must be encouraged\nto cut production to meet demand.\n    He is keen to reach an agreement on the milk problem before\nthe ministers move on to consider this year's annual price\nreview which proposes extending the new system for butter sales\nto other sectors such as cereals.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 2-MAR-1987 14:11:33.71"},"673":{"date":" 2-MAR-1987 14:11:39.24"},"674":{"title":"SEARS <S> TO RESTRUCTURE DISTRIBUTION","body":"Sears, Roebuck and Co said it will\nrestructure its distribution operations, resulting in a 20 mln\ndlr after-tax charge against earnings in its first quarter.\n    The retailer on April 30 will close its major Chicago\ndistribution center as the first part of the restructuring.

A source\nclose to the management side insisted that timing was on his\nside. He said if outside directors approve the management\nproposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders\nwith proxy material going out late this week. \"It would take 20\ndays from the day we mail,\" said the source.\n    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by\ninvestor Sumner Redstone, would need \"half a year\" to complete\na tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must\naccompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses\nand cable television franchises.\n    Redstone was not available for comment.\n    Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare\nsituation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war.

Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.\n    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon.

The\nmanagement plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5\nbillion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred\nstock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.\n    Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,\na fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a\nvalue of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock\nstock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity\ninterest in the restructured Viacom.

The arbitrageur said the equity portion\nwas worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.\n    Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he\nwould pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond\nApril 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The\nplan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct\nduring May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered\neight pct interest.\n    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management\ngroup, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,\nwere offering high prices. \"Redstone really wants to own the\ncompany,\" one said. Another said management seemed to have the\nedge on the timing issue.\n    Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.\n    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what\nthe equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth.

the\ngoods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left\nthe government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the\neconomy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment said.\n    With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct\nthis year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb\nto 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9\npct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.\n    The report said the French economy was \"increasingly\nill-adapted to demand\" selling goods at \"uncompetitive relative\nprices on both domestic and export markets.\"\n    \"France's poor export performance reflects a geographical\nbias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...\nAnd...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18\nmonths,\" it said.\n    Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit\nto around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,\nit warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the\nfranc could lead to \"a (renewed) loss of competitiveness\nrelative not only to the United States but also to the newly\nindustrialised countries.\"\n    This could result in further major losses of market share,\nparticularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a\nquarter of French exports, it said.\n    Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the\nauthorities would have \"little scope for macroeconomic\nmanoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to\nencourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow\nmore briskly,\" it added.\n    But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage\ndemands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a\ntwo pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.\n    Written mainly in December last year, the report took no\naccount of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct\nsurge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the\ngovernment's deregulation of service sector tariffs.\n    \"We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke\nrunaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has\nbeen lost,\" one OECD official commented.\n    OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil\nprices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the\nreport, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast\nto around 2.5 or three pct.\n    The government last week revised its forecast up to between\n2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct.\n    But the OECD backed the government's view that the\nunderlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,\nwith a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's\nfall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of\ndisinflation.\n    With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in\nthe OECD area, the inflation differential between France and\nits main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one\npct this year, it said.\n    On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for\nindustrial goods and private services have been rising steeply\nas companies built up their profits.\n    \"For the disinflationary process to continue , and price\ncompetitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange\nrate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,\"\nit said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 2-MAR-1987 18:03:14.58","topics":["gnp","trade"],"organisations":["oecd"],"places":["france"]},"844":{"title":"PAINEWEBBER<PWJ> UNIT UPS SHAER SHOE

At a time when the\nstability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor\nnations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely\nundermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.\n    U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury\nSecretary Baker on issues like international debt and global\neconomic cooperation.\n    The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate\nthe banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in\nwhich he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,\nsignalled the politically-independent central bank is coming\naround at least partially to the Treasury position.\n    And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official\nthat the two men saw \"exactly eye-to-eye\" on the dollar was seen\nas an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.\n    Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's\nreappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.\n    The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed\nTreasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a\ngood working relationship, in part because he believed the two\nkey government economic institutions have to work closely.\n    Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first\nterm, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm\nMerrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's\npre-eminent economic spokesman.\n    He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political\nskills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took\nmuch more seriously.\n    But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to\nstay. \"Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay\notherwise,\" said one. \"He'd have to be asked,\" said Stephen\nAxilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed\nand now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.\n    Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not\nawe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave\nbehind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.\n    Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --\nthe four sitting members were all appointed within the last\nthree years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global\neconomy is threatened by instability.\n    An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a\nnecessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of\nState George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary\nunder Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist\nwould make him ideal.\n    But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran\nscandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37\nyears old as too young for the job.\n    Other potential candidates include economist Alan\nGreenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic\nadviser, New York Fed President E.

At a time when the\nstability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor\nnations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely\nundermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.\n    U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury\nSecretary Baker on issues like international debt and global\neconomic cooperation.\n    The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate\nthe banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in\nwhich he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,\nsignalled the politically-independent central bank is coming\naround at least partially to the Treasury position.\n    And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official\nthat the two men saw \"exactly eye-to-eye\" on the dollar was seen\nas an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.\n    Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's\nreappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.\n    The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed\nTreasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a\ngood working relationship, in part because he believed the two\nkey government economic institutions have to work closely.\n    Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first\nterm, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm\nMerrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's\npre-eminent economic spokesman.\n    He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political\nskills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took\nmuch more seriously.\n    But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to\nstay. \"Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay\notherwise,\" said one. \"He'd have to be asked,\" said Stephen\nAxilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed\nand now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.\n    Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not\nawe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave\nbehind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.\n    Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --\nthe four sitting members were all appointed within the last\nthree years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global\neconomy is threatened by instability.\n    An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a\nnecessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of\nState George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary\nunder Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist\nwould make him ideal.\n    But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran\nscandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37\nyears old as too young for the job.\n    Other potential candidates include economist Alan\nGreenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic\nadviser, New York Fed President E.
