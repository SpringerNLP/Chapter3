The restructuring touched off a flurry of\nfriendly and hostile takeover attempts.\n    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire\nUnion Carbide Corp <UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs\nfor Borg Warner Corp <BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics\nand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace <GRA> \nhas divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer\nbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.\n    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be\nheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back on\nthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as\nethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that\nare custom-designed for a small group of buyers.\n    \"Companies like DuPont <DD> and Monsanto Co <MTC> spent the\npast two or three years trying to get out of the commodity\nchemical business in reaction to how badly the market had\ndeteriorated,\" Dosher said. \"But I think they will eventually\nkill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche\nmarket.\" Some top chemical executives share the concern.\n    \"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting\ncarried away and repeating past mistakes,\" GAF's Heyman\ncautioned. \"The shift from commodity chemicals may be\nill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\"\n    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the\nSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700\nmln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.\n    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout\nof Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1\nbillion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants\nalong the Texas Gulf Coast.\n    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that\nare the building blocks of specialty products.\n    \"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a\nglamorous, high-margin business,\" Cain said, adding that demand\nis expected to grow by about three pct annually.\n    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said\nchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for\nplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood\nand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical\nbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided the\nU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 8-APR-1987 11:18:37.67","topics":["pet-chem","crude","acq","earn"],"places":["usa"]},"15064":{"title":"FEDERAL PAPER BOARD <FBO> IN MARKETING DEAL","body":"Federal Paper Board Co Inc said\nit has named Ozaki Trading Co Ltd of Osaka to represent it it\nJapan on the sale of bleached paperboard.\n    Federal said it plans to open its own Japanese office in\nthe near future.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 8-APR-1987 11:20:27.61","places":["usa"]},"15065":{"title":"FIDATA CORP <FID> 4TH QTR LOSS","body":"Shr loss two cts vs profit 38 cts\n    Net loss 90,000 vs profit 1,685,000\n    Revs 1,826,000 vs 29.3 mln\n    Year\n    Shr profit 3.37 dlrs vs profit 46 cts\n    Net profit 15.0 mln vs profit 2,047,000\n    Revs 26.2 mln vs 123.6 mln\n    NOTE: Net includes pretax securities sale gain 10,000 dlrs\nvs loss 1,000 dlrs in quarter and gain 486,000 dlrs vs loss\n112,000 dlrs in year.\n    Net includes pretax gains on sale of businesses of nil vs\n4,656,000 dlrs in quarter and 26.0 mln dlrs vs 4,656,000 dlrs\nin year.\n    Net includes pretax losses on disposition of product line\nof nil vs 3,150,000 dlrs in quarter and 3,300,000 dlrs vs\n3,150,000 dlrs in year.\n    Quarter net includes tax credits of 102,000 dlrs vs 736,000\ndlrs.\n    Net includes reversal of tax loss carryforwards of 259,000\ndlrs vs 264,000 dlrs in quarter and tax loss carryforwards of\n8,635,000 dlrs vs 579,000 dlrs in year.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 8-APR-1987 11:21:05.09","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"15066":{"title":"CMS <ACMS> UNVEILS FIRST IBM SYSTEM/2 ADD ONS","body":"CMS Enhancements Inc said it has\nintroduced the first add-on mass storage products for the new\nInternational Business Machines Corp <IBM> IBM Personal\nSystem/2 Model 30 personal computers.\n    CMS said the products are available immediately and include\nhard disk drives, tape backup subsystems and a hard disk drive\non an expansion card.\n    It added it plans to introduce more products for higher-\nend models of the IBM personal computers within the next two\nmonths.\n    Prices for the new products range from 795 dlrs for a tape\nbackup subsystem, to 5,695 dlrs for a mass storage subsystem.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 8-APR-1987 11:21:19.09","places":["usa"]},"15067":{"title":"MARBLE FINANCIAL CORP <MRBL> 1ST QTR NET","body":"Oper shr 26 cts vs not given\n    Oper net 866,000 vs 480,000\n    NOTE: 1987 net excludes 157,000 dlr gain from termination\nof pension plan.\n    Company went public in August 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 8-APR-1987 11:21:24.56","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"15068":{"title":"NANTUCKET <NAN> NAMES NEW HEAD FOR UNIT","body":"Nantucket Industries Inc said James\nAdams has been named president of its hosiery division,\nreplacing John Wineapple, and Terry Hampton has been named vice\npresident of manufacturing for the division, replacing Howard\nFromkin.\n    No reason was given for the changes.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 8-APR-1987 11:22:35.93","places":["usa"]},"15069":{"title":"DOMINION TEXTILE CALLS REPORT OF BID FOR BURLINGTON RUMOR\n","date":" 8-APR-1987 11:23:52.75","topics":["acq"]},"15070":{"title":"RAYTHEON CO 1ST QTR SHR 1.37 DLRS VS 1.19 DLRS\n","date":" 8-APR-1987 11:25:35.47","topics":["earn"]},"15071":{"title":"FREEPORT <FTX> TO ACCRUE INTANGIBLE COSTS","body":"Freeport-McMoRan Inc said it\nhas decided to begin accruing a portion of its estimate of the\nintanmgible drilling and development cost recapture amount as a\ncost in determining payments to be made to Freeport-McMoRan Oil\nand Gas Royalty Trust <PMR> unitholders.\n    Freeport said this is expected to reduce monthly payments\nby about two cts per unit starting with the distribution\npayable July 10 to holders of record May 29.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 8-APR-1987 11:26:59.29","places":["usa"]},"15072":{"title":"ATT <T> DEVELOPS SUPERCONDUCTING WIRE","body":"American Telephone and Telegraph Co said\nit has developed superconducting wires that can easily be\nformed into coils.\n    It said when cooled to 91 degrees Kelvin, or 296 degrees\nbelow zero Fahrenheit, the wires conduct electricity without\nresistance.\n    ATT said the wires are made of a barium-yttrium-copper\noxide compound.

The\ncompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\nrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\n    Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit\nnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\nalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\n    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\nEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\ninto the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer\nmarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We\nhave the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\npoint,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\nhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\n    \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\nmarket, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that\nwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\ntaste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\nregionalized.\n     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\nAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\nimportant beer growth markets in the long term.\n     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\nmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\nhampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\n    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\nper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\nand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\n1986 sales.\n    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\nof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\nhave been looking at other possibilities.\n    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\nthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\nhad sold successfully, Coebergh said.\n    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\nmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\npopular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not\npossibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.\n    Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to\npenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\ncontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\n    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's\nmarket potential.

But Volcker\nhas warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught\nwith danger.\n    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as\nimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign\ncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.\n    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other\nmajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of\nthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates\nshould be stabilized at around current levels.\n    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to\ntake steps to stimulate their economies and the United States\nagreed to cut its budget deficit.\n    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a\nway to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is\nto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.\n    \"If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else\nyou do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recent\ntestimony before the Senate Banking Committee.\n    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the\ngovernment's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit\nsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or\nto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United\nStates.\n    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the\ncurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.\n    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed\nthat any deficit reduction was better than none.\n    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were \nnot enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it\nneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar\nfrom plunging further in world exchange markets.\n    \"There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if\nyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the\nFed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer\nis, it's not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters.\n    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's\nmost vexing and persistent problems.\n    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet\nlittle indication that this year's figure will be any lower,\nthough administration officials have predicted it will drop by\nabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.\n    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep\nworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the\nfederal budget.\n    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not\nattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for\nthe 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced\nbudget law.\n    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for\nnext year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget\nCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fall\nshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.\n    \"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the\nmost you're going to get\" out of Congress at the present time,\nsaid Touche Ross's Collander. \"To do something more than that\nwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\"\n    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up\nshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.\n    \"To an extent, this has become the minimum

He added that West German growth forecasts would\nhave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop\nto 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.\n    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets\nhad parted company with transactions in goods, services and\ninvestments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that\ndetermined market trends.\n    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to\ngrow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates\nwould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\n    \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\ndifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\nthose needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\nmounting economic activity,\" Koehler said.\n    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.\nCurrent account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation\ngoing by talking the dollar down posed problems.\n    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep\nrise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost\nof European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports\nto the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to\nmake itself felt compared with the price effect.\n    \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going\nfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current account\nover the medium term,\" Koehler said.\n    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur\nonly if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.\nIn Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should\nrise faster than GNP.\n    \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said.\n    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be\nprevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by\nan inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..\n    But only if there was an appropriate interest rate\ndifferential would Europe and Japan look for financial\ninvestment in the U.S.\n    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank\nhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its\nmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.\n    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates\nby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading\ninterest rates because of the signal this gives to the market\nand its substantial impact on exchange rates.\n    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of\nprice stability, economic growth and full employment but also\nto tackle international problems like the exchange rate\nproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem.\n    A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguarding\nof non-inflationary economic growth in an international\nmonetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said.\n    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was\nnecessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed\nto tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over\nthe next few years and intervention points should not be set,\nbecause they were only testing points for the market, he said.\n    In order to keep the international monetary system free of\ndisruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but\nalso cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 8-APR-1987 18:00:34.46","topics":["interest","money-fx"],"places":["west-germany"]},"15365":{"title":"AUSTRALIAN UNEMPLOYMENT RISES IN MARCH","body":"Australia's seasonally adjusted\nunemployment rate rose to 8.4 pct of the estimated workforce in\nMarch from 8.2 pct in February and 7.9 pct a year earlier, the\nStatistics Bureau said.\n    The number of jobless rose to 650,700 from 631,900 in\nFebruary and 593,200 a year earlier, the Bureau said.\n    Unadjusted, the number of unemployed rose to 702,600 from\n699,600 in February but the rate eased to 9.0 pct from 9.1,\nreflecting a slight increase in the estimated workforce.

Bolger said the\narticle was an April Fool's joke.\n    Labour's reforms have brought unexpectedly strong tax\nrevenues, a lower budget deficit and less state borrowing, an\nimprovement in the balance of payments, a reduction in foreign\ndebt and improved productivity, economists said.\n    Inflation should peak at 19.5 pct in the quarter ended\nMarch 31 and fall to about eight pct within a year, they said.\n    Labour's reforms have hit every sector, but the most\ndramatic was the \"corporatisation\" of seven government\ndepartments on April 1, which critics argue is the first stage\nstep towards the sale of state assets, the analysts said.\n    The move stops short of privatisation, as the state will\nretain ownership, but the new corporations are expected to be\nfinancially self-supporting and pay dividends.\n    Arguments have already broken out over money. One utility,\nElectricorp, said its assets are worth less than 3.8 billion\ndlrs yet the Treasury wants 8.5 billion for them.\n    No agreement has been reached on the value of assets of the\nformer forest service, the analysts added.\n    Chairman Alan Gibbs said in a speech the forest service had\nbeen losing 100 mln dlrs annually, yet due to economies it now\nemployed less than 30 pct of its previous workforce and the new\ncorporation would pay the state a dividend of at least 20 mln\ndlrs in its first year.\n    Uncertainties have also arisen over the government, as the\nonly shareholder, retaining the right to order the new\ncorporations to undertake certain projects although the full\ncost must be met by the state, the analysts said.\n    Deputy prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said managers would\nbe held accountable for performance, with the government paying\nfor projects undertaken for social or environmental reasons.\n    This policy has already caused problems, the analysts\nadded. For example, Electricorp has refused to spend several\nhundred million dlrs to build a hydro project at Luggate,\nfurther up the Clutha river from the Clyde high dam now under\nconstruction in Central Otago.\n    Prime Minister David Lange said this week that Labour MPs\nhad decided last year that Luggate be built and it was\nimportant that the government honour its promises.\n    \"But it is also a matter of importance that we do not see\nmany more jobs lost because of economic distortion than we\nwould save by having that promise honoured to the last,\" he\nadded.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 8-APR-1987 23:49:48.57","places":["new-zealand"]},"15370":{"title":"HOSPITAL CORP OF AMERICA <HCA> GETS MERGER BID","body":"Hospital Corp of America said it\nreceived a letter today from an investor group offering to buy\nthe company for 47 dlrs a share.\n    Based on 82 mln outstanding shares, the offer is worth\nabout 3.85 billion dlrs.

The organisation, formed in 1948 to\nintegrate the world's free market economies, now regulates 80\npct of world trade.\n    The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list of\ndetailed questions to China next month at the start of long and\ncomplex entry negotiations, the diplomats said.\n    One diplomat said China's prospects are good, with its\napplication supported by the United States, Japan and the\nEuropean Community for political and economic reasons.\n    \"The fear is that if China was refused entry, it would draw\nback the bamboo curtain and go back to the way it was,\" he said.\n    Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings.\n    \"If GATT accepted China, it would be hard not to accept the\nSoviet Union,\" he said.\n    \"China's agreement will be seen as a model for the Soviet\nUnion. GATT is not a political body.\"\n    But serious problems have to be tackled during the talks,\nincluding China's pricing system and trade subsidies.\n    GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs and\npromote trade, with prices alone dictating who buys what.\n    One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establish\nthe real cost of goods because many prices are set by the state\nand often contain subsidies.\n    \"Even when you go in person to a factory or a company to try\nto find out the real cost of something, officials do not give\nyou a clear answer. The political meaning is evident. They do\nnot want to answer,\" he said.\n    China's position, as set out in a memorandum to GATT in\nFebruary, is that it is gradually reforming its price system to\nbring prices in line with real production costs and replace\nadministrative controls with market ones.\n    Another diplomat said countries with centralised economies\nsuch as Hungary and Yugoslavia had joined GATT. However, China\nwould not apply for membership on similar terms, but rather as\na less developed country entitled to preferential treatment.\n    He added that the economies of Hungary and Yugoslavia are\nsmall, while China's is huge and its weight would be felt.\n    \"It (China) is the world's number two producer of coal, for\ninstance,\" the diplomat said. \"It could have a very large impact\non world trade.\"\n    Another sticking point is the subsidies China pays its\ncompanies to export so it can earn foreign exchange to pay for\nvitally needed technology, equipment and raw materials.\n    A Japanese trader said China lost money on every tonne of\ngrain it exported, because it had to make up the difference\nbetween a low world price and a high domestic price.\n    A western diplomat said an official of a foreign trade\nbureau of a major inland Chinese city told him export subsidies\nmight be as high as 100 pct for some products.\n    \"When I asked what the subsidy figure was for the whole\ncountry, he referred me to the Ministry of Finance, adding with\na grin that they would not tell me,\" he said.\n    He said officials were unwilling to give figures because of\nthe sensitivity of the subject.\n    \"Unless something is done to change this, China will find\nmany countries in GATT putting restrictions on imports from\nChina,\" the diplomat added.\n    In a major speech on the economy late last month, Planning\nMinister Song Ping made an indirect reference to this problem.\n    \"While trying to expand exports to earn more foreign\nexchange, we must improve economic accounting practices and\nreduce the cost of exports,\" he said.\n    One diplomat said China's freedom to change its foreign\ntrade and pricing system to bring them more in line with GATT\nprinciples could conflict with domestic pressures. China has\nsaid there will be no major price reforms this year following\nwidespread discontent in 1985 and 1986 from a public used to\nstable prices since the Communist takeover in 1949.\n    \"So the question is how fast and how thoroughly can China\nreform its economy?,\" the diplomat said. \"How can it balance the\nrequirements of GATT membership with domestic political needs?\"\n    But he added the advantages of China's entry would in the\nend outweigh these problems.\n    \"China's entry would force it to modernise and become more a\npart of the world economy,\" he said.\n    \"Just as China would get increased access to foreign\nmarkets, so it would have to give more access to its domestic\nmarket to foreign countries.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 9-APR-1987 04:20:25.68","organisations":["gatt"],"places":["china"]},"15383":{"title":"Burmah Oil 1986 pre-tax profit 105.9 mln stg vs 79.6 mln.\n","date":" 9-APR-1987 04:24:40.70","topics":["earn"]},"15384":{"title":"GERMAN BANKERS' REMARKS REVIVE TALK OF RATE CUT","body":"Remarks by two leading central bankers\nsparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in\nthe West German three pct discount rate may be under\ndiscussion, currency dealers said.\n    Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that\nmonetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows\nrequired cuts in interest rates.\n    Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter\nHiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below\nits lowest ever point of 2.75 pct.

While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of\nintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent\nyears.\n    Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary\nBaker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the\nlight of the Japanese announcement.\n    They also said there was a growing feeling among the\nfinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over\nmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term\ndifferences in past meetings.\n    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like\nthe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of\nyesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other\ncountries that its exchange rate is acceptable.\n    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that\nmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance\nbetween West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's\ntrade deficit have already taken place.\n    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut\nthe budget deficit even though it is implied in the\nreafffirmation of Paris.\n    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are\nessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that\nreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.\n    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this\nweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further\nsharp fall to redress trade imbalances would \"clearly pose\nsubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could\nundermine confidence in future financial stability,\" he said.\n    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the\npolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.\n    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany\nwelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own\ncurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.\n    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak\ndollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the\nJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.\n    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making\ntheir policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian\nFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.\n    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit\nto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.\n    The United States and France, backed by the International\nMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or \"norms\" for a\nlimited number of economic objectives such as growth,\ninflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current\naccount balances.\n    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in\nconsultations between the countries on whether corrective\naction should be required.\n    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives\nhas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it\nimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.\n    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully\nsounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit\ncurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting.\n    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges\nof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the\nrelatively free currency markets of recent years.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 9-APR-1987 08:33:49.59","places":["usa","uk","france","west-germany","italy","canada","japan"]},"15471":{"title":"BELGIUM LAUNCHES BONDS WITH GOLD WARRANTS","body":"The Kingdom of Belgium is launching 100\nmln Swiss francs of seven year notes with warrants attached to\nbuy gold, lead mananger Credit Suisse said.\n    The notes themselves have a 3-3/8 pct coupon and are priced\nat par.

They can be sold freely on\nthe stock market by simple endorsement while debentures can\nonly be sold to the company after one year, brokers said.\n    Government companies are trying to capitalise on a boom in\nthe stock market since 1984/85 sparked by liberal tax\nconcessions and reforms in exchange operations, brokers said.\n    The National Thermal Power Corp, NTPC, was the first\ngovernment company to issue the bonds to raise one billion\nrupees in January last year, breaking the monopoly of private\ncompanies on the capital market. The seven-year NTPC bond was\noversubscribed three times, brokers said.\n    Official figures show bonds floated by government companies\nhave been heavily oversubscribed. More state companies have\nsought the Ministry's permission to issue them in coming\nmonths.\n    NTPC's second bond issue at the end of 1986 raised 4.51\nbillion rupees against 1.2 billion originally permitted by the\nFinance Ministry.\n    The Mahanagar Telephone Nigam mobilised 3.83 billion rupees\nlast year against authorised 1.5 billion and last month the\nIndian Railway Finance Corporation's record susbcription\ntotalled 5.5 billion rupees against authorised 2.5 billion.\n    In most cases, the government has allowed the companies to\nmaintain the oversubscribed amount, brokers said.\n    Goenka said that government bonds are making it\nincreasingly difficult for private companies to launch new\nequity or debenture issues. He said the government could at\nleast \"fix a suitable limit on the funds to be raised through\nsuch bonds by the public sector.\"\n    Merchant bankers said the government is pressing state\ncompanies to borrow from the public by reducing financial\nsupport to them.\n    To ease its internal debt burden, the government has\nreduced the budgetary support to development investment in\nabout 120 public sector companies to 69.92 billion rupees in\n1987/88 from 77.92 billion a year earlier, official figures\nshow.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 9-APR-1987 09:07:36.45","places":["india"]},"15489":{"title":"SUNTRUST BANKS INC <STI> 1ST QTR NET","body":"Shr 54 cts vs 49 cts\n    Net 70.2 mln vs 64.0 mln\n    NOTE: Share adjusted for two-for-one split in July 1986.\n    Results restated for pooled acquisition of Third NAtional\nCorp in December 1986.\n    Net chargeoffs 15.0 mln dlrs vs 14.2 mln dlrs.\n    Assets 25.8 billion dlrs, up 7.2 pct from a year earlier,\ndeposits 21.1 billion, up 9.4 pct, and loans 17.1 billion dlrs,\nup 17.2 pct.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 9-APR-1987 09:10:51.76","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"15490":{"title":"SUNTRUST <STI> PUTS LOANS ON NONACCRUAL","body":"SunTrust Banks Inc said in the first\nquarter it placed about 20.2 mln dlrs of loans to Brazil and\n21.6 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on nonaccrual status.\n    The company made the disclosure in reporting that first\nquarter earnings rose to 70.2 mln dlrs from 64.0 mln dlrs a\nyear earlier.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 9-APR-1987 09:10:56.74","places":["usa"]},"15491":{"title":"ROPAK <ROPK> FORMS JAPANESE UNIT","body":"Ropak corp said it has formed\na new Tokyo-based subsidiary called Ropak Nippon Ltd to market\nits North American products in Japan.\n    It said the new unit has started importing plastic pans and\nother products for the packaging of seafood and will also\nmarket rigid-plastic shipping pails for a variety of packaging\nuses.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 9-APR-1987 09:11:03.45","places":["usa","japan"]},"15492":{"title":"BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES <BUR> SELLS CONVERTIBLES","body":"Burlington Industries Inc is raising 75\nmln dlrs through an offering of convertible subordinated\ndebentures due 2012 with a 6-1/4 pct coupon and par pricing,\nsaid lead manager Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc.\n    The debentures are convertible into the company's common\nstock at 63.50 dlrs per share, representing a premium of 18.1\npct over the stock price when terms on the debt were set.\n    Non-callable for three years, the issue is rated Ba-2 by\nMoody's Investors Service Inc and BBB by Standard and Poor's\nCorp.

The yen sank below 145 at one point\ndespite intervention by the Bank of Japan.\n    Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the\nmovement since Paris was consistent with currency trading\nranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.\n    \"I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past\nseveral weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the\ndiscussions in Paris,\" Miyazawa said yesterday.\n    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was\nannounced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of\nMiyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's\nmeetings of leading industrial nations.\n    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action\n\"extraordinary and urgent\", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris\nAccord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges\nbroadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.\n    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West\nGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore\nrepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to\nfoster exchange rate stability.\n    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central\nbank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the\ndollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of\nintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent\nyears. Monetary sources also said they understood that\nSecretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely\nsuccessful in the light of the Japanese announcement.\n    They also said there was a growing feeling among the\nfinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over\nmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term\ndifferences in past meetings.\n    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like\nthe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of\nyesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other\ncountries that its exchange rate is acceptable.\n    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that\nmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance\nbetween West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's\ntrade deficit have already taken place.\n    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut\nthe budget deficit even though it is implied in the\nreafffirmation of Paris.\n    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are\nessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that\nreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.\n    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this\nweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further\nsharp fall to redress trade imbalances would \"clearly pose\nsubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could\nundermine confidence in future financial stability,\" he said.\n    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the\npolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.\n    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany\nwelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own\ncurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.\n    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak\ndollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the\nJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.\n    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making\ntheir policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian\nFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.\n    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit\nto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.\n    The United States and France, backed by the International\nMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or \"norms\" for a\nlimited number of economic objectives such as growth,\ninflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current\naccount balances.\n    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in\nconsultations between the countries on whether corrective\naction should be required.\n    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives\nhas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it\nimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.\n    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully\nsounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit\ncurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting.\n    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges\nof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the\nrelatively free currency markets of recent years.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 9-APR-1987 10:10:03.25","topics":["dlr","yen"],"places":["usa","japan","uk","west-germany","france","italy","canada"]},"15550":{"title":"BANK OF FRANCE LEAVES INTERVENTION RATE UNCHANGED","body":"The Bank of France said it left its\nintervention rate unchanged at 7-3/4 pct when it injected funds\nin the market against first category paper in today's money\nmarket intervention tender.\n    Money market dealers had earlier expressed mixed views on\nthe possibility of quarter point cut.\n    The rate was last adjusted on March 9, when it was cut to\n7-3/4 pct from the eight pct rate set in January.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 9-APR-1987 10:10:58.67","topics":["interest"],"places":["france"]},"15551":{"title":"GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS","body":"The global economy is expected to\nweaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious\npoverty outlook, economic analysts said.\n    For finance ministers and central bankers attending this\nweek's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund\nand World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an\nadditional concern.\n    The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct\nthis year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.\n    In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a\nmeasure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to\n2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.\n    For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,\nanother measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0\npct from 3.5 pct last year.\n    The new figures are considered a major disappointment to\nthe poorest countries.

But, in tacit recognition of\noverseas pressure, the ministry set a six pct target for\nJapanese banks with overseas branches.\n    But foreign bankers say the rub was that it allowed Japan's\nbanks to count 70 pct of the value of their massive holdings of\nJapanese shares - their so-called hidden reserves - as capital.\n    Without the shares, big Japanese banks would only have\ncapital ratios of around three pct. With them, their ratios are\nwell above six pct, especially after the recent record-breaking\nclimb of Tokyo share prices.\n    Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far too\nhigh by the ministry.

Special arrangements would be sought for those who\naccept the offer but are unable to pay.\n    Miller said the offer did not imply Lloyd's accepted\nresponsibility for the affair, uncovered in the late autumn of\n1982 when \"it became quite clear that (PCW agency founder) Peter\nCameron Webb and (his partner) Peter Dixon had perpetrated\ntheft upon members,\" he said.\n    Part of the sum involved was subsequently recovered and\nrepaid to members, but Cameron Webb and Dixon left the affairs\nof PCW syndicates \"in a state of chaos which led to a sharp\ndeterioration of their underwriting results,\" Miller said.

Yeutter said agriculture will also be on the agenda\nof the trade ministers \"quadrilateral\" talks among\nJapan, the European Community, the U.S. and Canada this month.\n    And the ministerial meeting of the Paris-based Organization\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, in May will\nhighlight the agriculture problem, Yeutter said.\n    The OECD in May is expected to release a study of domestic\nfarm subsidies which shows that Japan has the highest subsidies\namong industrial countries, but aid to farmers is also generous\nin the EC and United States.\n    The controversial OECD study calculated a measure of farm\nsubsidies called the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, which\nallows farm aid to be compared across countries.\n    Some officials including British Agriculture Minister\nMichael Jopling, have said the PSE could be useful as a method\nof negotiating lower domestic farm subsidies worldwide.\n    However, the State Department's Wallis said while the PSE\ncan be useful in negotiations, it has shortcomings and \"its not\ndefinitive.\"\n    He and other U.S. officials said the Reagan administration\nhas not yet reached a decision on a specific U.S. agriculture\nproposal to present to the GATT.\n    \"I would expect it (U.S. proposal) to be in the fall,\"\nafter the series of international meetings, Wallis said.\n    At preliminary meetings of the GATT agriculture committee,\nthe United States has pushed for the so-called \"freeze and\nrollback\" approach. Subsidies would first be frozen at current\nlevels, then rolled-back jointly in stages.\n    However, the Reagan administration perplexed some trade\nanalysts recently by reacting cooly to a plan by Australian\nprime minister Bob Hawke calling for a similar approach. Hawke\nunveiled a seven-point plan to freeze and subsequently reduce\nthe gap between high farm price supports and world prices.\n    Australia is leading a the so-called Cairns group of 13\ncoutries pressing for freer agriculture trade.\n    \"The proposals that the so-called Cairns group are coming\nup with seem to be focusing on short-run, quick fixes which is\nnot what we think is what's called for here,\" Wallis said.\n    Wallis and other said the U.S. wants a \"long-range\"\nsolution to the agriculture problem.\n    U.S. officials also have criticized the Australian proposal\nbecause they said it deals primarily with the difference\nbetween domestic prices and world levels in the EC and U.S.,\nbut fails to focus on the question of market access.\n    At the same time the U.S. is rejecting the Australian\n\"quick fix\", Wallis said the U.S. will press at the summit for\na declaration urging that agriculture talks be completed\n\"expeditiously\", or within two years.\n    The unstated U.S. strategy, U.S. officials said, is to keep\nthe pressure on the EC this year through the export enhancement\nprogram and lower value of the dollar, in the hope that a\nsweeping agriculture agreement is possible in 1988.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 9-APR-1987 12:42:10.84","organisations":["gatt","oecd"],"places":["usa"]},"15739":{"title":"TAFT BROADCASTING <TFB> COMPLETES STATION SALE","body":"TVX Broadcast Group Inc\n<TVXG> said it has completed the previously-announced purchase\nof five Taft television stations.\n    Last week, TVX said the sale, which was scheduled to close\nthen, had been delayed.\n    Taft said the purchase price was 240 mln dlrs, as\npreviously announced.

However, by the close of\ntrading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slide\nin aftermarket activity.\n    Dealers noted that the spread to Treasuries is wide for a\nnewly-priced AAA-rated borrower like Japan Development Bank.\nFor example, earlier this week, the World Bank raised U.S. Dlrs\nat only 25 basis points over Treasuries. Dealers said that\nbecause the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- the\nlast time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.\n    But officials at Bank of Tokyo said the spread is intended\nto compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertainty\ncurrently associated with owning dollar securities.\n    The officials said the borrower opted to raise funds in\ndollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is the\nonly market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size.\nJapan Development Bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.\n    Market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped into\nyen as the borrowers previous issues were.\n    Late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its fees\nat less 1.75 less 1.55.\n    Also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering from\nToshiba International Finance (Netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8\npct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.\n    Three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered,\nthe largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by Sekisui\nChemical Co and guaranteed by Sanwa Bank Ltd.

A\nsimilar deal yesterday by Toronto Dominion, priced slightly\nhigher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, was\nquoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.\n    Dealers said that investors are apparently willing to\naccept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points less\nthan annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retail\nbuyers. Also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest rates\nfall in Australia as many analysts expect, the potential for\ncapital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. The bonds are also\nbetter for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.\n    Dealers said that the Australia dlr zero coupon bonds are\napparently being placed with retail accounts on the European\ncontinent with very little placement being done in Japan.\n    Euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices on\ndomestic Japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade as\nthe yen soared.

Many banks said that they had for some time been\nproviding more than the legal minimum of information.\n    Traditionally, notes or private placements, as they were\nalso known, were medium term instruments denominated in 50,000\nfrancs and placed largely with institutional investors.\n    They were normally not brought onto the open market and\nnever quoted on the stock exchange.\n    But over the years the distinction between notes and the\npublicly quoted and traded bonds gradually broke down. The\nNational Bank therefore last May abolished all remaining\nrestrictions on maturities and denominations which still\nformally divided them.\n    However, it was not in the competence of the National Bank\nto rule on prospectuses and banks have since continued largely\nas before: public issues, generally quoted on stock exchanges,\nhave been provided with detailed prospectuses, while notes,\nvirtually always not-quoted, have been equipped only with\n\"information memorandums\" with varying degrees of detail.\n    The new convention attempts to put an end to this. It says\neach notes prospectus must contain the following seven points:\n    - The precise terms of the issue\n    - Details of the company performance if it is more than six\nmonths since the last annual report\n    - Naming of all guarantors\n    - The source of the information\n    - Details of ratings, insofar as they have been made\n    - For equity linked notes, details of where the company's\nshares are listed and price high and lows over at least the\nlast three years.\n    - That the lead manager has required the borrower to\nprovide information during the lifetime of the notes on the\nprogress of his business.\n     According to figures from Swiss Bank Corp, total note\nissues by foreign borrowers reached 18.6 billion Swiss francs\nlast year, compared with 23.6 billion francs borrowed in the\nform of public bonds.\n    A majority of the note issues were for Japanese borrowers.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 9-APR-1987 13:14:05.13","places":["switzerland"]},"15766":{"title":"BRAZIL GOVERNORS CALL FOR REMOVAL OF FUNARO","body":"Brazil's political crisis appears\nto be deepening as powerful state governors are calling for the\nremoval of Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, chief architect of\neconomic policy.\n    Commentators said their call, front-page headlines in\ntoday's press, laid bare President Jose Sarney's political\nweakness and highlighted Brazil's economic planning turmoil.\n    The demand for Funaro's resignation came last night from\nfour governors with much combined political clout, those of Sao\nPaulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul.

TALKS WITH BANKS","body":"Argentina's Economy Minister Juan\nSourrouille said the \"narrow interest\" of creditor banks was\nholding up an accord to stretch out debt repayments and warned\nArgentina may break off negotiations.\n    \"It is inadmissible that the private narrow interest of some\nbanks threatens to turn into an insurmountable obstacle for a\npolicy we have agreed with the international community,\"\nSourrouille said.\n    Speaking to the International Monetary Fund's Interim\nCommittee meeting, Sourrouille said Argentina had given ample\nproof that it is negotiating seriously with the banks.\n    \"Today, with that same responsibility, we are clearly\nstating that it will be imposible for us to continue\nnegotiating on that basis.\"\n    A monetary source who heard Sourrouille's speech from a\nvantage point close to U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker,\nsaid Baker turned to one of his advisors to ask for the names\nof banks that Sourrouille said were stalling on an agreement.\n    \"Let's give them a call right away,\" the source quoted Baker\nas saying.\n    Sourrouille reminded the Interim Committee that the IMF\nlast February approved a 1.3-billion-dlr stand-by loan and a\nlonger-term credit, known as an extended Fund Facility for\nanother 500,000 dlrs.\n    But he said that despite Argentina's \"disciplined effort\" to\nachieve inflation-free economic growth, it was unable to obtain\nIMF payouts due to the link between that arrangement and\nsettlement of a separate agreement with creditor banks.\n    Sourrouille  stated flatly that the banks were flouting a\nlong-established practice under which debtor countries which\nreached agreements on economic reforms with the Fund were a\ngood credit risk for the banks.\n    \"In other words, facts are demonstrating that the current\ndebt strategy is showing that an IMF agreement is only a weak\nsignal for the beginning of another discussion (with the\nbanks),\" he stated.\n    He added the fact that the strategy is not working was also\ndemonstrated when governments that approved Argentina's program\nhad to join in a bridge loan for his country.\n    Sourrouille stated that Argentina has met IMF requirements\nregarding its balance of payments and its monetary and fiscal\npolicies.\n    Despite this Sourrouille said, \"What we are facing is the\ninexplicable demands (from the banks) that are blocking\nnegotations.\"\n    Argentina, with a foreign debt of 50 billion dlrs, has been\nseeking to reschdule 24 billion dlrs in \"old debt\" and another\n4.2 billion dlrs that had been refinanced in 1985.\n    The minister also said there were two issues separating\nArgentina from an accord with creditor banks, one was a minimum\ndifference on the interest rate margin above international\nlevels.\n    The other condition, of more concern, were suggestions by\nthe banks that would upset the country's financial system.\n    Monetary sources said creditor banks have been offering\nArgentina the London Interbank rate (Libor) plus 7/8 pct, which\nthey gave Venezuela in a recent refinancing agreement.\n    The sources said Argentina is committed to winning the\nlower spread Mexico gained last year of 13/16 pct above Libor.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 9-APR-1987

The\nunion is fighting the move in court.\n     In response to a question, Duncan said the company's\nlatest proposal for a new three-year contract, which was\noffered March 11, does away with a two-tiered system of pay,\nwhereby new employees are paid on a lower scale than those\nhired before 1983.\n     However, the union has contended that the company's\nproposal keeps the system in a disguised form.\n     A union spoksewoman had no immediate response to\nAmerican's announcement.\n     Currently, the airline and the union are in the middle of\na federally-mandated 30-day cooling off period that was\ntriggered after both sides rejected a federal mediator's offer\nof binding arbitration.\n     When the period ends on April 25, the union is free to\nstrike and the company is free to unilaterally impose its\nlatest offer under the Federal Railway Labor Act.\n     Even though the union has repeatedly said it will not\nstrike, Duncan confirmed today that the company has received\npermission from the Federal Aviation Administration to speed up\nthe hiring of new attendants.\n     In response to a question, Duncan denied the company was\nthinking of firing attendants who do not comply after the 25th.\n     \"It (the speeded-up hiring) is a precautionary measure,\"\nhe said.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 9-APR-1987 16:34:01.75","places":["usa"]},"15983":{"title":"BRITISH AIRWAYS <BAB> SUSPENDS PROMOTION","body":"British Airways said it suspended sale\nin the U.S. of its \"Europe on Us\" for travel from the U.S. due\nto disapproval by the U.S. Department of Transporation on\ngrounds of reciprocity.\n    Under the promotional program, customers would buy a round\ntrip from the U.S. to London and would receive a free round\ntrip ticket from London to one of 45 cities in 16 countries.\n    A company spokesman said the Transportation Department's\ncontention was that American carriers could not compete in this\nprogram.
