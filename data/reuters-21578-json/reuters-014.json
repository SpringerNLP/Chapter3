He predicted there would be mergers and\nindividual firms would carve out specialised niches to ensure\ntheir survival in a deregulated climate.\n    Ogren said the sector's losses on bad loans were bound to\nrise steeply in 1989-1990 due to the rush to increase credit.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 11:27:05.91","places":["sweden"]},"14101":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 11:27:09.78"},"14102":{"title":"WALL STREET STOCKS HIGHER IN LATE MORNING","body":"Wall Street stocks staged a strong\nrebound after being hurt by an early round of futures related\nsell programs and profit taking.

He might have to pay with the presidency.\n    Calls are increasing for direct presidential elections to\npick a successor to Sarney early next year. The length of his\nterm will be decided by a Constituent Assembly, and Sarney has\nbeen lobbying for a six-year term.\n    Sarney came to power, without facing presidential\nelections, in March 1985, when the military bowed out after 21\nyears of rule.\n    Although there was wide public support for direct \nelections for president, the military as one of their last\nacts, insisted an electoral college, where it felt it had more\ninfluence, make the choice.\n    The college chose Tancredo Neves, a popular politician who\nheaded the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), which\nhad opposed military rule.\n    In part to smooth relations with the military, Neves chose\nSarney, a supporter of the generals, for the purely ceremonial\npost of vice-president. But Neves died before he could take\noffice and Sarney took power.\n    He won the grudging support of the PMDB and the Cruzado\nPlan was wildly popular with inflation-weary Brazilians.\n    But the Cruzado Plan failed and politics in Brazil has not\nbeen the same.\n    \"The country is a rudderless ship,\" said a U.S. Diplomat,\nechoing a common view that the government lacks any clear idea\nof how to tackle the economic crisis.\n    Sarney has appeared increasingly isolated, with criticism\ncoming from the business community, the trade unions, some of\nthe military, the media and political opponents.\n    Many businessmen are unhappy with Sarney's decision\nannounced on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68\nbillion dlrs of foreign debt.\n    A motor industry executive said: \"The business community\nthinks Brazil should go to the IMF. Their rules are sometimes\nharsh and strict, but this is the only way to put the house in\norder.\"\n    Trade unions generally support the debt moratorium, but\ndisagree with other aspects of government policy. Since the end\nof February they have organized national strikes of seamen,\nbankworkers and federal university teachers and countless local\nstoppages and protests.\n    Economic problems have prompted criticism from some\nmilitary figures, including the last army ruler, General Joao\nFigueiredo. It is a sign of the times that almost daily\nmilitary men deny there is going to be a coup.\n    If the army does stay in the barracks, the key arbitors of\nSarney's fate will be the PMDB's leaders. So far, they have not\ntaken a clear stand on the issue of direct elections.\n    But one PMDB leader, Senator Affonso Camargo, pointedly\nsaid yesterday that it was the sovereign right of the\nConsituent Assembly to call direct elections for the presidency\nwhenever it wished.\n    In the media, Sarney has to contend with strong criticism.\n    One senior political commentator, Fernando Pedreira of the\nJornal do Brasil, wrote in the newspaper last week:\n    \"President Sarney is ... a man of good intentions, but it\nis just possible that he himself is not aware of the true state\nof the country and the people since the immense failure of the\nCruzado Plan.\n    \"The disappointment, the frustration, the irritation, the\nenticement have been (and continue to be) too great, too\nprofound.\"He called for direct elections early in 1988 as the\nonly way out of the present crisis.\n    One of Sao Paulo's leading news magazines, Senhor, said in\nan editorial this week: \"The anarcho-populist government of\nPresident Jose Sarney has failed. Two years have already been\ntoo long for such a disastrous experience.\n    \"It deserves to be buried as quickly as possible. The\nnatural solution: direct elections soon.\"\n    The government's inability to control inflation is now\nbringing with it serious social problems.\n    An explosion in rents in Sao Paulo has thrown tens of\nthousands of families onto the streets because they can no\nlonger afford to pay even for a wooden shack in the slums.\n    The local press says the city is experiencing the biggest\nwave of land invasions in its history.\n   According to rental agencies, rents have increased 500 pct\nin little more than a year. Even the cheapest shacks now cost\n2,000 cruzados (90 dollars) a month, half as much again as the\nminimum wage, which is all that many earn.\n    Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, the Roman Catholic archbishop\nof Sao Paulo, warned yesterday of the possibility of \"a social\nconflict of unimaginable proportions.\"\n    With his back to the wall politically and with social\ntensions rising, Sarney is no position to compromise on debt.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 16:36:25.77","places":["brazil","usa"]},"14636":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 16:36:50.59"},"14637":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 16:36:58.92"},"14638":{"title":"WALL STREET STOCKS CLOSING AVERAGES","body":"Prices closed lower in active trading\non the New York Stock Exchange.\n    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.60 to 2360.94\n    The NYSE Index fell 2.61 to 168.35\n    Declines led advances 1121 to 504\n    The average share price was 67 cts lower.\n    Volume was 186,410,000 shares compared to 173,720,000\nyesterday.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 16:37:45.20"},"14639":{"title":"AMEX STOCK PRICES CLOSE LOWER","body":"Prices on the American Stock Exchange\nclosed lower in active trading.\n    The AMEX Index fell 0.59 to 341.64.\n    The Average price per share was three cts lower\n    Declines led advances 326 to 282\n    AMEX volume rose to 14,224,710 shares from 12,855,230\nyesterday.\n    Options volume was 345,250 compared to 324,863 yesterday.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 16:38:03.98"},"14640":{"title":"BRAZIL SETS UP SPECIAL DEBT COMMISSION","body":"Brazil has set up a special debt\ncommission, headed by Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, to be\nresponsible for renegotiating Brazil's 109 billion dollar\nforeign debt, officials said.\n    The principal negotiator on the commission, created by\nPresident Jose Sarney, will be former foreign minister Ramiro\nSaraiva Guerreiro.\n    Officials said Guerreiro would be joined on the commission\nby eight senior officials, including a representative of the\nNational Security Council.\n    The creation of the commission is intended to underscore\nthe Brazilian government's contention that the debt issue is\nessentially political and that a political solution must be\nfound to the problem.\n    On February 20 Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68\nbillion dlr foreign bank debt to try to force the issue.\n    Creditor banks, however, have signalled that they are\nequally determined to resist Brazil's demands for debt relief.\n    Yesterday Funaro travelled to the U.S. for fresh debt\nnegotiations with creditors deeply angered by Brasilia's\nsuspension of interest payments.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 16:38:42.66","places":["brazil"]},"14641":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 16:38:59.90"},"14642":{"title":"DESJARDINS GROUP LOWERS VISA INTEREST RATE","body":"(La Confederation des Caisses\nPopulaires et d'Economie Desjardins), the Quebec credit union\ngroup, said it is lowering the interest rate on unpaid balances\non its Visa credit card to 15.9 pct from 18.0 pct, effective\nwith June billing statements.\n    The move follows cuts in credit card interest rate charges\nby several Canadian banks.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 16:39:08.28","topics":["interest"],"places":["canada"]},"14643":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 16:39:52.77"},"14644":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 16:40:24.34"},"14645":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 16:40:35.33"},"14646":{"title":"SEEQ TECHNOLOGY INC <SEEQ> 2ND QTR MARCH 31","body":"Shr profit eight cts vs loss 1.84 dlrs\n    Net profit 785,000 vs loss 4,279,000\n    Revs 10.4 mln vs 8,464,000\n    Avg shrs 9,649,000 vs 2,664,000\n    Six Mths\n    Shr loss nine cts vs loss 4.09 dlrs\n    Net loss 262,000 vs loss 9,689,000\n    Revs 19.2 mln vs 15.6 mln\n    Avg shrs 2,874,000 vs 2,660,000\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 16:40:55.16","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"14647":{"title":"TX/W OKLA FEEDLOT CATTLE STDY/UP 0.50 DLR-USDA","body":"slaughter steers were fully steady and\nheifers steady to 0.50 dlr higher in moderate trade, the usda\nsaid.\n    Feedlots reported fairly good interest and inquiry from\nbuying sources.\n    Sales on 6,800 steers and 2,400 heifers. week to date\n48,900 head.\n    steers - good and mostly choice 2-3 1025-1150 lbs\n69.50-70.00.\n    heifers - good and mostly choice 2-3 925-1025 lbs\n68.00-68.50.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 16:41:13.59"},"14648":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 16:41:27.15"},"14649":{"title":"N.Y.

No other\nstate in U.S. history has faced such a deficit.\n    \"There is a strong independent streak in Texans and five\nyears ago I would never have dreamed the State Legislature\nwould institute an income tax,\" said George Bland, Assistant\nProfessor of Political Science at North Texas State University,\nadding, \"Now my contacts at the Legislature tell me it's\ncoming, it's inevitable, it's only a matter of time.\"\n     State taxes on oil and gas production traditionally\nsupplied as much as a third of the state's revenues.\n    However, that source has fallen to about 15 pct in recent\nyears, and with last year's price slump, the state's dependence\non sales taxes is approaching 50 pct.\n     Bland said he believes the Tax Reform Act will be a major\nfactor in the state's decision because under it sales taxes are\nno longer deductible from federal income tax while state income\ntax is.\n    John Kennedy, senior research associate at the Austin-based\nTexas Research League said, \"There is a great deal of popular\nsentiment against it, plus the first plank of Governor\nClements' platform was no tax increases, let alone a new tax.\"\n    However, he said that since the oil price fall the state\nfaced a choice of either instituting an income tax or\nbroadening and possibly raising the sales tax.\n    Steve Pejovich, director of the Center for Free Enterprise\nat Texas A and M University and an opponent of income taxes,\nsaid he favored reforming the present tax system to take\naccount of the changed structure of the economy.\n    \"We should rely less on traditional sources, such as oil\nand agriculture and real estate and more on service industries,\nmanufacturing and high-tech,\" Pejovich said.\n    Tony Proffitt, an aide to State Comptroller Bob Bullock\nsaid, \"Bullock is opposed to an income tax, but has warned the\nLegislature that if they get tired of looking at everything\nelse, that's the only option.\"\n    Apart from Texas, states which have no individual income\ntax are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota,\nWashington and Wyoming \n    For the time being, Attorney General Jim Mattox has ruled\nthat the Legislature may carry over the current one billion dlr\ndeficit into the next biennium, even though the state\nconsitution requires a balanced budget.

Earlier this\nyear, both houses of the Legislature, citing financial\nrestraints as well as teacher morale, passed bills abandoning\nplans to require teachers to take competency tests.\n    Bland said he believes the state will set up a commission\nnext year to \"study alternative revenue sources,\" with an\nincome tax being instituted as early as January 1989.\n    \"If the political leaders are educated about (the effects\nof the Tax Reform Act), I think there will be a gradual drift\ntoward income tax,\" he said.\n                \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 18:34:36.71","places":["usa"]},"14750":{"title":"GYNEX <GYNXU>, SEARLE END MARKETING PACT","body":"Gynex Inc said that Gynex Labs\nand G.D.

Now\nit's largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd\nfinancial analyst Simon Smithson.\n    Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to\nenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American\ninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5\npct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at\nleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange\npersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other.\n    \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the\nFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.\n    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.\n    \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,\nwe can do various things. We only have to wait two or three\nyears, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.\n    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes\ninto the securities business at home.\n    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's\nversion of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial\nfrom investment banking.\n    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu\nsaid he hopes further deregulation will create new\nopportunities.\n    \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some\ncases these will be securities related, in some cases trust\nbank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.\"\n    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such\ndomestic securities business as profitable government bond\ndealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co\nLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.\n    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering\nthe securities business here through its Swiss universal bank\nsubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.\n     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to\nsecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,\nfollowing a similar decision for subsidiaries of European\nuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.\n    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar\ndecision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\n    \"We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed\nin two or three years,\" he said.\n    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand\nlending to individuals and small and medium businesses to\nreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added.\n    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of\ntime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the\nmerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.\n    \"It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said\nKleinwort's Smithson.\n    \"After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling\naround. It will be the next decade before we see if the\nstrategy is right or wrong.\"\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 8-APR-1987 03:29:34.51","topics":["acq"],"places":["japan","usa"]},"14844":{"title":"SUBROTO SAYS INDONESIA SUPPORTS TIN PACT EXTENSION","body":"Mines and Energy Minister Subroto\nconfirmed Indonesian support for an extension of the sixth\nInternational Tin Agreement (ITA), but said a new pact was not\nnecessary.\n    Asked by Reuters to clarify his statement on Monday in\nwhich he said the pact should be allowed to lapse, Subroto said\nIndonesia was ready to back extension of the ITA.\n    \"We can support extension of the sixth agreement,\" he said.\n\"But a seventh accord we believe to be unnecessary.\"\n    The sixth ITA will expire at the end of June unless a\ntwo-thirds majority of members vote for an extension.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 8-APR-1987 03:45:20.53","topics":["tin"],"places":["indonesia"]},"14845":{"title":"SOUTH AFRICA MINES BODY SEES MAY DAY WORK STOPPAGE","body":"Negotiations between mining\ncompanies and the National Union of Mineworkers are foundering\nand mines could face a May Day work stoppage, the Chamber of\nMines said.\n    It said the union had called off talks on a specific issue,\nthe introduction of a Labour Day on May 1.\n    The union refused a request to give advance notification of\nthe names of workers who would be working on May 1 rather than\ntaking the option of a paid holiday, the Chamber said.\n    It said mining companies wanted advance notice in order to\nplan their operations.\n    \"The union is adamant only employees who wish to work on\nLabour Day should notify management,\" the Chamber said.\n    \"This raises the prospect that the mines will once again\nface stay-away action on May 1 and that the employees who do\nnot work will once again forfeit pay.\"\n    It said the union accepted all the proposals except giving\nadvance notification for May 1.\n    It said miners had been offered a full paid holiday on May\n1 or a premium of six pct of their basic monthly pay for\nworking that day.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 8-APR-1987 03:49:29.05","places":["south-africa"]},"14846":{"title":"FINAL TERMS SET ON ATARI CORP CONVERTIBLE EUROBOND","body":"The coupon on the 75 mln dlr, 15-year,\nconvertible eurobond for Atari Corp has been set at 5-1/4 pct\ncompared with indicated range of five to 5-1/4 pct, lead\nmanager Paine Webber International said.\n    The conversion price was set at 32-5/8 dlrs, representing a\npremium of 20.38 pct over yesterday's Atari share close of 27\ndlrs.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 8-APR-1987 03:55:13.05","places":["uk"]},"14847":{"title":"BANGLADESH LIKELY TO SET HIGHER DEVELOPMENT PLAN","body":"Bangladesh is expected to draw up a 47\nbillion taka development plan for the 1987/88 fiscal year\nbeginning July 1, Finance Ministry officials said.\n    This is a rise of six pct over the current year.

introduce\nlegislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of\ncorporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.\n    Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,\nProxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased\nthe chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.\n    \"We are proposing legislation that would provide for more\ndisclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would\ninsure that takeovers are properly financed,\" he said.\n    Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold\nfor notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a\ninvestor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a\ncompany to three pct from the current five pct threshold within\n10 days, Proxmire said.\n    In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement\nthat an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have\nto filed with the SEC.\n    Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to\nprevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in\nknowing about coming takeover attempts.\n    Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a\ntender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60\nbusiness days from the current 20 business days.\n    His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring\ncompany violated the time period on the tender offer.\n    To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire\nsaid the legislation would aim at insuring current margin\nrequirments are properly enforced.\n    The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement\nfor purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally\nenforced in hostile takeovers.\n    Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover\ndeclare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without\nactually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.\n    He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for\nfailure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin\nrequirements.\n    The bill also would require more disclose when several\ninvestors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.\n    \"When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know\nabout it,\" Proxmire said.\n    Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain\ntowards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all\nshareholders recieve equal treatment.\n    He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover\ndefensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.\n    Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later
