Moscow's\ndecision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market\nstrengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.\n    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.\n    Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in\nthe way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement\nProgram, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to\nMoscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives\nhere as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was\npreparing an offer.\n    Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.\nAgriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped\nabout the prospects of a subsidy offer.\n    But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the\ncontention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,\nwhile not a \"done deal,\" is a live possibility.\n    Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom\nasked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an\noffer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.\n    Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,\nare saying they would not rule one out.\n    Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to\npredict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days\nto two weeks.\n    Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders\nwho had been in contact with administration officials.\n    Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.\nWheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement\noffer would be made by the middle of this month.\n    Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end\nup being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this\nyear when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs\nper tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.\n    Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat\nsubsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of\nU.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.\n    As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal\nwould appear to be price.\n    Last summer the administration took the controversial step\nof offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were\nembarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds\nthat the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices\nfar above world market prices.\n    The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up\nfront instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a\nmeans of controlling the price while attempting to dampen\ncriticism, grain trade sources said.\n    Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz\nfrom saying the Soviets were \"chortling\" because Washington was\noffering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to\nU.S. housewives.\n    The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives\nhere is that a general warming of relations between the two\ncountries since last summer, combined with continued hard times\nin the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.\n    In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider\nbuying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.\n    However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances\nsurrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat\nsubsidy offer last summer.\n    Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and\nindustry leaders were led to believe the White House had\ndecided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not\nonly the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.\n    Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to\ninclude only the Soviets.\n    That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of\nuncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced\nthat the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to\nsell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 1-APR-1987

But Hannes\nAndrosch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> told\nReuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers.\n    Vak told a news conference that last January's cut in\nlending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors\nby a quarter point had been insufficient.\n    The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering of\nits discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a\nsimilar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and\ndeposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct.\n    Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche\nZentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a\npoint, or even half a point if German rates dropped further.\n    Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. A\nwidening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German\ncredit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth\nthis year also justified a further interest drop, he said.\n    Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank der\noesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called for\nlower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain\nunchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small,\nparticularly when compared with other West European countries.\n    But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste Oesterreichische\nSpar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unless\nWest German rates came down first.\n    Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates\nalone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming\nopposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 1-APR-1987 12:27:48.50","topics":["interest"],"places":["austria"]},"12085":{"title":"A.G.

The importance of complementary\nchanges in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when\na change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantly\nachieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a\nweek through open market intervention.\n    After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to\n7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last August, the\ndollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50\nyen, up two yen from Tuesday's New York low.\n    By contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank\nof Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion\ndlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the\ndollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low\nMonday of 144.70 yen.

The market is saying that\nthe dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit is\nshowing little sign of improvement, while Japan is resisting in\na bid to protect its export industries.\n    For its part, the United States is apparently content to\nlet the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more\nthan lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group\nof Five plus Canada to foster stability, dealers say.\n    Specifically, they said the Fed's dollar-buying\nintervention has been half-hearted, designed more as a\npolitical gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the\nmarkets. \"It's been pro-forma intervention,\" said Francoise\nSoares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais.\n    Because of this discord and the market's momentum for a\nlower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail.\n    \"It's going to take a lot more than the central banks to\nhold the dollar (at these levels),\" said Snow, who predicts\nanother 10 to 15 pct depreciation.\n    \"There have to be structural changes that occur to make the\nmarket stop selling dollars,\" added \"Buying six billion dollars\nin three weeks is not going to do it.\"\n    Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter,\nwhen the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack,\ncentral banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion\ndlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar\nfalling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said.\n    Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. \"I\ndon't think anybody has the stomach for it, because they saw\nthe futility of it in the seventies.\"\n    Indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and bound\nsince then, intervention on an even greater scale would\nprobably be needed to impress the market.\n    Trading volume in London, New York and Tokyo alone last\nyear averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to a\njoint central bank study, about double the previous estimate\nmade just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private\nresearch group.\n    There are signs that central banks, too, realize the\nfutility of swimming against the tide.\n    Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this\nweek that they believed the limits of currency market\nintervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods\nfor bolstering the dollar, such as invoking currency swap\nagreements with other central banks, are being considered.\n    \"In this era of financial liberalization, it's almost\nimpossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,\"\none senior official in Tokyo said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 1-APR-1987 13:20:07.33","topics":["dlr","money-fx"],"places":["usa"]},"12137":{"title":"MICHAELS STORES <MKE> MARCH SALES RISE","body":"Michaels Stores Inc said March\nsales were up 19.2 pct to 7,823,000 dlrs from 6,564,000 dlrs a\nyear earlier, with same-store sales up 2.7 pct.\n    The company noted that Easter sales fell in March last year\nand are falling in April this year.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 1-APR-1987 13:21:32.53","places":["usa"]},"12138":{"title":"CANADIAN TIRE MAJOR HOLDERS NOT EXTENDING PACT","body":"CTC Dealer Holdings Ltd said <Canadian\nTire Corp Ltd> controlling shareholders Alfred, David and\nMartha Billes did not extend an agreement expiring yesterday to\ntender their shares only to CTC's previously reported offer for\n49 pct of Canadian Tire common shares.\n    CTC, which already holds 17.4 pct of Canadian Tire common,\nsaid it would therefore not take up any shares tendered under\nits offer unless they totaled at least 1.1 mln or another 32.7\npct of Canadian Tire common.

the\n300 mln dlrs in tariffs, despite seemingly contradictory\ncomments by some Administration aides.\n    A visit here next week by Japanese trade officials and a\nvisit to Tokyo by a senior State

Some U.S. officials had hinted the United States and Japan\nmight settle their dispute in time to hold off the tariffs, but\nthis has now been dismissed by other senior officials.\n    They noted that negotiations over compliance with the pact\nhad been going on for several months, with little success.\n    Japanese firms this week announced plans to cut chip output\nand increase U.S. chip imports, but U.S. officials said Japan's\nmove was too late to stave off the American tariffs.\n    The tariffs are to be imposed after a period of public\ncomment, but Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said any\nsettlement would probably come too late to delay the tariffs.\n    U.S. Trade Represenative Clayton Yeutter predicted Japan\nwould not be able to comply with the pact in time to hold off\nthe new

The\ncontract expired at midnight March 31.\n    Krieger said the committee is empowered to call a strike if\nit sees fit but he added, \"we're not gun shy and we're not\nstrike-happy, we don't take it lightly.\" He said the union\nneeded time to draft a formal response to the NBC proposal,\nwhich the network billed as its \"best and final offer.\"\n    A spokeswoman for NBC said management personnel were\nprepared to take assume technical duties if its radio and\ntelevision facilities are struck.\n    \"If there were a strike, we would not expect any\ninterruption in our service,\" the NBC spokeswoman said. At CBS\nand ABC, where the Writers Guild of America has been on strike\nsince early March, viewers have noticed little difference in\nthe programs. However technicians are not involved in the\nwalkout at CBS and ABC.\n    Krieger said the \"major stumbling block\" in the talks with\nNBC was the network's insistence on having the right to hire\nengineers and writers on a daily basis. \"In a broad sense this\nwould decimate the union,\" he said, with temporary workers\njeopardizing the jobs of staff employees.\n    NBC said its proposal \"contains assurances that there is no\nintention to replace regular employees with daily hires.\" NBC\nsaid regular employees who may be on layoff would be offered\nemployment first.\n    NBC also said any daily hires would be represented by the\nunion and would be phased in at four pct of regular staff in\nthe first year of a contract and six percent afterward.\n    Top scale wages would increase to 855 dlrs per week in the\nfirst year of the two-year contract and 895 dlrs in the second\nyear, under the NBC proposal. Krieger said the network's wage\nproposals were \"disappointing\" but not the main issue.\n    NBC said its proposals would give it greater flexibility in\nsports and news coverage. It said its proposals would permit\nlimited access to news materials from affiliates and\nsubscription services and allow Cable News Network to join\nnetwork pool facilities. Cable News Network is owned by Turner\nBroadcasting System <TBS>.\n    Material from subscription servoces would be limited to an\naverage of about one minute in a half-hour program, NBC said.\nThe network said the changes it seeks \"would reduce costly\nduplication and are vital to NBC's long term health.\"\n    The major U.S. networks have experienced cost cutting\ncampaigns following a series of ownership changes that affected\nthe parent companies of all three in the past two years.\n    Laurence Tisch became the largest shareholder in CBS, NBC's\nformer parent RCA was acquired by General Electric and ABC was\nmerged into Capital Cities Broadcasting.\n    The broadcast operations have been hit with layoffs and\nother belt-tightening measures.

He said all but essential state firms\nshould become joint stock holding companies, with the state\nholding a controlling share that could be as low as 33 pct.\n    The professor argued this would separate government\nadministrators from managers of the firms, a key goal of\nChina's reforms. He said his plan would make the companies\nindependent units under a board of directors.\n    The diplomat said the dropping of share issues may be the\nresult of conservative backlash since the January resignation\nof reformist Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang. He said share\nissues raise sensitive questions: \"What happens if the value\nfalls? People are not used to this and may be dissatisfied.\nWhat happens if a person gets very rich through share\nownership? The government does not want disparity in income.\"\n    One Chinese journalist said conditions are not ripe for\nwidespread share issues. \"In China, the success or failure of a\nfirm does not entirely lie within its own hands.

His holdings are also under sequestration.\n    \"The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are\nowned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers,\" Diaz said. \"Naturally we do\nnot want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies.\"\n    PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down\npayment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary\nNeptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year.\n    The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be\nforfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to\nfulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally\nnegotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos.\n    PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines' largest food and\nbeverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln \"B\" class shares\nfrom the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a\nprice of 150 pesos per share.\n    The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso\ntransaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500\nmln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred\nshares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollected\ndividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to\nUCPB-controlled trading companies.\n    The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share\nmade by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15\npct stock dividend declared in June last year.\n    A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board met\ntoday to discuss the proposed compromise.\n    The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board\nmeeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration.\n    President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to\nset up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership\nissue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15.\n    Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMC\nboard, filed a formal complaint before the Securities and\nExchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight other\ndirectors of violating \"fiduciary duty.\"\n    De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC's\nboard last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 2-APR-1987 05:49:23.68","topics":["acq"],"places":["philippines"]},"12444":{"title":"BANK OF FRANCE SELLS 8.45 BILLION FRANC TAP STOCKS","body":"The Bank of France said it sold a total\n8.45 billion francs worth of treasury tap stocks through its\nlatest monthly tender, at which it offered a choice of one\nfloating rate and two fixed rate tranches.\n    It sold 3.6 billion francs worth of the treasury's 8.50 pct\nJune 1997 tap at an average price of 96.86 pct giving an\naverage yield of 8.78 pct, up from 8.72 pct at its last tender\nof the same tap a month ago.\n    It also sold 3.15 billion worth of 8.50 pct November 2002\nstock at an average price of 97.24 pct and average yield of\n8.83 pct, against 8.98 pct when it was last sold on January 8.\n    The bank sold 1.7 billion francs of floating rate 1999 tap\nstock at an average price of 97.06 pct, giving an average\nspread of 0.39 percentage points above the 13-week treasury\nbill reference rate, little changed from the 0.40 point spread\nat the last offering a month ago.\n    Total demand at today's auction was 28.7 billion francs,\nincluding 5.1 billion for the 8.50 pct 2002 tranche, 13.95\nbillion for the 8.50 pct 1997 tranche and 9.65 billion for the\n1999 floating rate tranche.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 2-APR-1987 05:51:38.58","places":["france"]},"12445":{"title":"TOKYO OPTICAL ISSUES EQUITY WARRANT EUROBOND","body":"Tokyo Optical Co Ltd is issuing a 40 mln\ndlr equity warrant eurobond due April 27, 1992 paying an\nindicated coupon of 2-1/4 pct and priced at par, lead manager\nDaiwa Europe Ltd said.\n    The issue is guaranteed by Mitsui Bank Ltd and final terms\nwill be set on April 9.

I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie\nhimself to a fixed rate,\" Brett said.\n    Currency markets were keen for official statements to\nclarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency\ntrading.

Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine.\"\n    Not all analysts played down the significance of the\nremarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of\nCanada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate\nsterling from the fortunes of the dollar.\n    Although about two-thirds of Britain's trade is conducted\nwith European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed\nthe dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted.\n    \"Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or\nthrow in its lot with Europe,\" Dunn said.\n    \"It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to\njoin the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by\nshadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants\nthe U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark,\" he said.\n    Analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets following\nLawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base\nrates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term.\n    \"Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some\nextremely good economic indicators,\" Capel's Skeoch said.\n    Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March,\nthe last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts\nhad been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 2-APR-1987 06:03:36.27","topics":["interest","money-fx","stg"],"places":["uk"]},"12448":{"title":"NV HOOGOVENS 1986 NET PROFIT 154.6 MLN GUILDERS VS 278.8 MLN -- OFFICIAL\n","date":" 2-APR-1987 06:12:23.55","topics":["earn"]},"12449":{"title":"RANK MAKES INCREASED AVANA OFFER FINAL","body":"Ranks Hovis McDougall Plc <RHML.L> said\nit was making an increased and final offer for the Avana Group\nPlc <AVNA.L>.

industry, a Western expert said.\n    West German economics researcher Jochen Bethkenhagen, in a\nreport presented to a NATO economics seminar, said increased\ntargets for Soviet nuclear energy output showed the April,\n1986, disaster had not caused any change in Moscow's energy\npolicy.\n    But the accident was expected to prompt design changes in\nfuture Soviet power stations to \"exclude manipulations of safety\nequipment\" of the sort that occurred at Chernobyl, he said.\n    This will presumably result in substantial delays in the\ncompletion of reactor blocks and in stricter quality controls\nduring the construction of nuclear power stations, he said.\n    Bethkenhagen said the Chernobyl accident was also likely to\nhave frustrated for a long time Soviet hopes of exports of\nnuclear power stations to countries outside the Comecon bloc.\n    \"It is also doubtful that the talks with China, Syria, Libya\nand Iraq with regard to Soviet deliveries in the next few years\nwill have positive results,\" he said.\n    The meeting heard views of academics and Kremlin-watchers\non the impact of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on energy\npolicy.\n    Several participants today argued that Gorbachev was\nunlikely to extend his internal economic policies to the energy\nsector, at least for now.\n    Bethkenhagen said high energy growth targets set by the\nSoviet Union up to the end of the decade showed Moscow intended\nto stick to a rigid supply-, rather than demand-oriented\npolicy.\n    Norwegian academics Arild Moe and Helge Ole Bergesen said\nthat the Soviet fuel industries represented such a pillar of\nthe economy that immediate reform was tricky. \"Any 'experiment'\non a large scale cannot be allowed, because the negative\nconsequences if a reform backfires will be too great,\" they\nsaid.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 2-APR-1987 09:57:58.36","places":["belgium","ussr"]},"12553":{"title":"FLEET FINANCIAL <FLT>

Britain too is said to be concerned.\n    In late 1985, Washington called on multilateral development\nbanks, like the World Bank, and commercial banks to increase\nloans to the 15 major debtors by 29 billion dlrs over three\nyears.\n    In return, the major debtors were expected to undertake\nreforms promoting inflation-free economic growth, more open\nmarkets and a reduced government role in the economy.\n    The IMF was to retain a \"central role\" in the strategy,\nshifting its economic reform programs from emphasizing\nausterity to stressing growth, freer trade policies and foreign\ninvestment in debtor nations.\n    But monetary sources said some nations want even more\nflexibility from the IMF when it sets economic programs tied to\nloans for debtor nations.\n    Such flexibility would include less rigid economic targets\n-- which often lead to artificial crises when they are not met\n-- and more reliance on ranges and benchmarks to monitor\neconomic performance.\n    There is also concern that the level of IMF lending is too\nlow and the commercial banks, themselves under attack for\ntawdry loan levels to debtors, want to see it increased.\n    The IMF, which holds its semi-annual meetings with the\nWorld Bank next week, will only be a small net lender this\nyear. Much of its loan disbursements are offset by repayments.\n    Meanwhile, most countries, including the United States,\nacknowledge the banks have not lived up to their commitments.\n    Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is \nparticularly irritated with the reluctance of commercial banks\nto lend more to reforming debtors, monetary sources say.\n    New IMF managing director Michel Camdessus is understood to\nbe worried about the Fund's image in the developing world,\nwhere it is often depicted as the source of economic ills.\n    Camdessus' experience as former chairman of the so-called\n\"Paris Club\" of western creditor governments, has given him\nextensive first-hand experience of the debt crisis.\n    Brazil, which in February declared an interest paymernts\nmoratorium on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt, has\nflatly ruled out adopting a program of IMF-sponsored economic\nreforms. Peru too has rejected an IMF program, curbing debt\nrepayments to 10 pct of exports.\n    But the administration official said Brazil's strategy of\nusing a moratorium as a negotiating tool might backfire. \"It's\nprobably turning out to be more complicated than they thought.\nIt underlines the extreme risk that a debtor country takes on\nitself when it begins down that road,\" the official said.\n    Indeed, U.S. banks are laying the groundwork for writing\ndown their Brazilian loans.\n    U.S. officials have generally praised most debtors for\nadopting genuine economic reforms and the multilateral\ninstitutions for stepping up their lending.\n    And they point out that Venezuela, Chile and the\nPhilippines have struck agreement with commercial banks\nstretching out debt repayments.\n    But problems still dog assembly of a 7.7 billion dlrs bank\nloan for Mexico, which many officials acknowledge may be the\nlast major cash loan for a debtor country.\n    Instead, banks are being pressed to come up with more novel\nways of easing the liquidity squeeze in debtor nations.\n    The prospect of greater official involvement in the debt\nstrategy depends chiefly on the ability of western nations to\ncome up with more finance.\n    While there is sympathy in Congress for various forms of\ndebt relief, more U.S. funds for the World Bank or the IMF are\na virtual impossibility in today's era of budget restraint.\n    That leaves rich surplus nations like Japan and West\nGermany, but neither country favors generalized debt relief.\n    And the Reagan administration is not inclined to bow to\nCongressional pressure for changes in regulations governing\nforeign loans, to make it easier for banks to account for\ndelays in interest and principal repayments.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 2-APR-1987 10:53:39.49","organisations":["imf"],"places":["usa"]},"12599":{"title":"MORTON THIOKOL <TKI> UNIT TO MARKET RESINS","body":"Morton Thiokol Inc said its Morton\nChemical Division entered into an agreement with <Mitsubishi\nChemical Industries Ltd>, Japan, to market extrudable adhesive\nresins based on Mitsubishi's Novatec AP product line\ntechnology.\n    It said the resins are used in a broad range of\napplications, including barrier co-extrusion with nylon and\nEthylene-Vinylalcohol Copolymer for film, sheet and bottles.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 2-APR-1987 10:53:51.69","topics":["pet-chem"],"places":["usa"]},"12600":{"title":"HAWLEY BUYS U.S. CRIME CONTROL FOR 51.3 MLN DLRS","body":"<Hawley Group Ltd> said it has agreed to\nbuy <Crime Control Inc> of Indiana for 51.3 mln dlrs cash.\n    Crime control is a security service group that sells,\ninstalls and services electronic security systems which would\nexpand the coverage of Hawley's <Electro-Protective Corp> unit.\n    Hawley said the acquisition moved it into 12 new market\nareas including the West and South-West and would create the\nfourth largest provider of security systems in the U.S.\n    Hawley is a Bermuda-based holding company whose main\nsubsidiary is the U.K. Security, home improvements and cleaning\noperation <Hawley Group Plc>.\n    Earlier this week, Hawley launched a 196 mln stg\nrecommended offer for <British Car Auction Group Plc> and last\nmonth it said it planned to issue 150 mln dlrs in 15 year\nconvertible redeemable preference shares.\n    It said in a statement that Crime Control reported\noperating profit of 4.0 mln dlrs in 1986 and had end-year net\ntangible assets of 4.5 mln dlrs.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 2-APR-1987 10:54:42.28","topics":["acq"],"places":["uk","usa"]},"12601":{"title":"LAWSON SAYS STERLING TARGET COMMENTS INSIGNIFICANT","body":"Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\ncriticised media coverage of comments he made yesterday, when\nhe was reported as saying he wanted sterling to stay roughly\nwhere it was, specifying a rate of around 2.90 marks and 1.60\ndlrs to the pound.\n    Holding up a newspaper report on his comments headed\n\"Exchange Rate Targets Set\" Lawson told journalists \"This story is\na complete non-event.\"\n    He criticised the report, which said he was now targetting\nsterling against the dollar and mark. \"Nothing of the sort\noccurred,\" Lawson said.\n    Lawson said he had only told National Economic Development\nCouncil panel members what the pound's current dollar/mark\nrates were that day, after saying he was happy with current\nsterling levels.

General Foods' Maxwell House Div. has\njust cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrs\nfor 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate,\naccording to an A and P executive.\n    Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has \"nothing to announce at\nthis point\" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither does\nHills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third and\nfourth size market spot by volume with A and P.\n    Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress of\nGeneral Foods' offering, prepared to jump in if the market\ntakes off.\n    General Foods and A and P hope their new products will help\npush coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption in\nthe United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a\n1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales show\nno signs of picking up.\n    Compass's Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffee\nquality since the 1960's and aggressive soft drink marketing.\n    \"The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the name\nof profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers this\nwas quality coffee,\" Gallant said.\n    As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for the\nbrew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, \"they turn\naround and say 'My God this is awful, I think I'll have a\nCoke',\" he said.\n    Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who have\nconfirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers are\naiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd\n-- the yuppie composite.\n    \"Where else are you going to go?,\" an industry source said.\n\"Kids aren't going to drink coffee, that's apparent. There are\nno other markets. The only area that's not been promoted is\ngourmet,\" he said.\n    In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmet\nline could provide much higher margins to roasters than regular\nground roast coffees produce.\n    Generally, retail prices are about twice the price of\ngreen, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs of\nroasting, packaging and distribution, and then deducting\noften-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sell\ncoffee near the trade price as a \"loss leader,\" a product\ndesigned to draw shoppers into the store.\n    But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricing\nstructure prevails, industry sources said. There is no trade\ndiscounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including a\nspecial valve designed to keep the beans fresher.\n    Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality green\nbeans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb. Thus, retail prices on gourmet\ncoffee are now almost three times the price of green.\n    Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference.\nGeneral Foods claims 80 pct of consumers in their test market\nsurveys for Private Collection came back for more.\n    And product manager Brown points to the success of more\nexpensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling in\nrestricted high income areas and are now available in almost\nevery supermarket in the country.\n    A and P is similarly optimistic. \"We think we'll do\nextremely well in the gourmet market,\" Gallant said.\n    Maxwell House is marketing its eight types of Private\nCollection in selected high income areas, while A and P offers\nits 14 different whole bean gourmet coffees, called 8 O'Clock\nRoyale, only in their own stores in Philadelphia, Baltimore,\nNew York, Atlanta and some other metropolitan areas.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 2-APR-1987 15:33:26.07","topics":["coffee"],"places":["usa"]},"12702":{"title":"REEBOK <RBK> COMPLETED AVIA GROUP MERGER","body":"Reebok International Ltd said it\ncompleted the previously announced acquisition of <Avia Group\nInternational Inc> for about 180 mln dlrs or 16.35 dlrs a\nshare.\n    It said litigation begun by certain Avia stockholders\nchallenging the transaction and seeking damages is in the\npretrial discovery process.

host the\ninformal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bank\nchiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the\nlight of the February agreement among leading industrialised\ncountries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels.\n    In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accord\nbetween the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain\nand Canada had proved itself \"more or less workable.\"\n    But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been\ngrowing since fears of a trade war between the United States\nand Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a\nrecord low against the surging yen early this week.\n    The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being held\nto coordinate the EC's positions on monetary issues and Third\nWorld debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the International\nMonetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week.\n    The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main\ndiscussions will take place tomorrow.\n    Continued international currency turbulence could undermine\nplans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the joint\nfloat holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation\nbands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda.\n    Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of\ncalm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stable\ndollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make\nit more resilient against exchange rate swings.\n    The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as\nthe falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS\ncurrency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertake\ntwo major realignments of parities within nine months.\n    In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for a\nwide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMS\non the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the\nEC's Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank\nGovernors.\n    The committees were asked to come up with the proposals\nafter the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January.\n    Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, the\nfledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take over\nthe mark's dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has met\nwith a cool response in West Germany.\n    He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would report\nto the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise\ncapital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, such\nas the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls.\n    Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without\nstrengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in\nthe Community. \n    He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member\nstates were willing to push further towards the EC's goal of\nmonetary integration on the basis of an EMS that included\nmanagement of exchange rates by some kind of common\ninstitution, instead of by national central banks as at\npresent.\n    Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen by\nthe EMS's founding fathers, have been thwarted by the\nreluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove up\ntheir sovereignty in the monetary field.\n    EMS development has also been held up by Britain's refusal\nso far to join the system's core exchange rate mechanism.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 3-APR-1987

Sources said seven to 10 more seats on the\nexchange are likely to open up sometime in 1988.\n    For non-member firms, wrestling away market share from\ntenacious Japanese and foreign firms is costly and intangibles\nsometimes prove even more important than exchange membership.\n    \"Your name is better known if you're a member of the right\nclub,\" Miller said. \"It's easier to hire ...

With other costs this means a price in\nPakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.\n    Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and\ndue to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were\nissued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.\n    Aziz said following the introduction of a government\nsupport price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that\nonly 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the\nconsumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.\n    The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect\non the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.\n    Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of\nthe new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive\nPakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March\n1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.\n    Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a\nmajor effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better\nuse of side-products such as bran.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 3-APR-1987 10:22:32.46","topics":["wheat","grain"],"places":["pakistan"]},"12888":{"title":"KLEER-VU INDUSTRIES TO SELL COSMETICS UNIT","body":"<Kleer-Vu Industries> said the\ncompany's board authorized the sale of its Neslemur Co, its\ncosmetic and toiletries company.\n    The company said it is evaluating two separate proposals\nand will complete the sale within 10 days.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 3-APR-1987 10:22:37.02","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"12889":{"title":"MEMORY PROTECTION <MPDI> COMPLETES ACQUISITION","body":"Memory Protection Devices Inc said it\ncompleted its acquisition of the assets and liabilities of\nBogen, a division of <Lear/Siegler>, for 9,200,000 dlrs in\ncash.\n    Under the newly-structured company, Memory said it expects\nto report consolidated sales of 18 mln dlrs to 20 mln dlrs and\nshould be profitable before allowing for extraordinary items\nrelated to the acquisition.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 3-APR-1987 10:23:01.85","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"12890":{"title":"DU PONT <DD> TO SELL CLEVELAND PLANT","body":"Du Pont Co said it agreed to\nsell its Cleveland chemical plant, the oldest site currently\noperated by the company, to two employees.\n    Terms were not disclosed.\n    Closing is expected in the second quarter, following\napproval of definitive agreements.\n    Products made at the plant represent less than 1/10 of one\npct of Du Pont's annual sales, it said.

While some refer to a collective\nEFTA stance, officials admit that on many issues Switzerland\nmay have act alone.\n    The new EC plans on transport, for example, would have a\nsevere impact on Switzerland and Austria, whose roads carry\nmost of the traffic between Italy and its EC partners.\n    But rules such as the volume of petrol buses are allowed to\ncarry across a border have much less importance to Sweden or\nFinland.\n    Switzerland wants to work out ways to help people crossing\nits borders with West Germany, France and Italy. But it is\nafraid the liberal border controls Denmark, an EC member, has\nwith the non-EC Nordic countries might pose a threat to\nsecurity.\n   And pin the fields of banking and insurance -- the very\nlifeblood of Switzerland's service sector -- Swiss interests\ncould prove directly opposite to its EFTA partners with their\npppppppnarrow and tightly protected financial markets.\n    The biggest danger ahead, EFTA members have said, would be\nthat their divided interests might leave the EC free to set\nwhatever guidelines and standards it wanted and force them on\nother European states that wanted to trade.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 3-APR-1987 10:50:23.48","organisations":["efta","ec"],"places":["turkey","switzerland","austria","west-germany","france","norway"]},"12910":{"title":"CYPRUS LOWERS COPPER PRICE ONE CT TO 66 CTS","body":"Cyprus Minerals Company said it is\ndecreasing its electrolytic copper cathode price by one cent  \nto 66.0 cents a pound, effective immediately.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 3-APR-1987 10:53:13.27","topics":["copper"],"places":["usa"]},"12911":{"title":"ENSERCH <ENS> TO REDEEM DEBENTURES","body":"Enserch Corp said that it has called for\nredemption on May four all its outstanding 16-3/8 pct sinking\nfund debentures due 2007, pursuant to the optional redemption\nprovision of the indenture at 111.981 pct of par.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 3-APR-1987 10:53:28.90","places":["usa"]},"12912":{"title":"FREDDIE MAC ADJUSTS SHORT-TERM DISCOUNT RATES","body":"The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp\nadjusted the rates on its short-term discount notes as follows:\n   MATURITY   RATE       OLD RATE  MATURITY\n    31 days   5.95 pct   6.00 pct  32 days\n  \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 3-APR-1987 10:53:32.73","topics":["interest"],"places":["usa"]},"12913":{"title":"TRANS WORLD LIQUIDATING TRUST TO CLOSE BOOKS","body":"The Trans World Corp Liquidating Trust\nsaid it will permanently close its books of record and transfer\non April seven.\n    Beneficial interest in the trust ceased trading on the New\nYork Stock Exchange on March 31, it noted.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 3-APR-1987 10:53:37.74","places":["usa"]},"12914":{"title":"MAVERICK RESTAURANT CORP <MAVR> 4TH QTR LOSS","body":"Ended Jan 31\n    Shr loss 50 cts vs loss one ct\n    Net loss 2,475,739 vs loss 68,691\n    Revs 3,689,770 vs 3,292,733\n    Year\n    Shr loss 50 cts vs loss two cts\n    net loss 2,472,582 vs loss 112,936\n    Revs 14.8 mln vs 13.2 mln\n    NOTE: Current periods include charge of 2.25 mln dlrs or 45\ncts for restaurant closings.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 3-APR-1987 10:55:37.20","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"12915":{"title":"GRAPHIC MEDIA INC <GMED> YEAR NET","body":"Ended Jan 31\n    Shr nine cts vs eight cts\n    Net 246,000 vs 369,000\n    Revs 20.4 mln vs 11.2 mln\n    Avg shrs 2,123,000 vs 1,882,000\n    NOTE: 1985 restated.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 3-APR-1987 10:55:42.12","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"12916":{"title":"MISSED SENATE DEADLINE UPSETS U.S. BUDGET CHIEF","body":"White House Budget Chief James Miller\nsaid he was irritated by the Senate Budget Committee's failure\nto meet an April 1 deadline for completing action on its budget\nblueprint for the coming fiscal year.\n    \"I'm terribly upset that they've missed their deadline,\" he\ntold reporters after a speech commemorating the 100th\nanniversary of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).\n    Senate Budget Chairman Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) \"is obviously\nhaving trouble getting a majority (of his committee) to agree\nto his budget,\" Miller said.

However, this\nwas mainly designed to prevent a grey market springing up in\nequities prior to listing.\n    They pointed out that in contrast to the many uncertainties\nconnected with an issue of equity securities, there would be\nfew imponderables relating to bonds just about to be issued by\nthe Bank of England.\n    Senior market sources noted that in any case \"when issued\"\ntrading would be supervised by the Stock Exchange and would be\nsubject to Bank of England supervisory guidelines.\n    Since the Bank of England and market-makers themselves are\nknown to be in favour of the idea, the sources said, there was\nnow a presumption that there would be scope for \"when issued\"\ntrading to take place.\n    Gilt sales now are effected by means of large-scale stock\ntenders or by tap issues of stock tranches direct to the\nmarket. But greater market capitalisation following the \"Big\nBang\" restructuring last year provided an opportunity for\nchange.\n    A combination of both systems would enable the Bank to\nbenefit from both the flexibility offered by traditional\nmarketing methods and the guarantee of a steady supply of funds\nimplied by auctions.\n    The Bank said in a consultative document published in\nFebruary that possibly two or three experimental auctions might\neach raise between one to 1-1/2 billion stg.\n    The remainder of the funding would be conducted by\ntraditional tender and tap issue means.
