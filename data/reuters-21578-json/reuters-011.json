But he said\nit may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half\npoint, to avoid hurting the dollar further.\n    All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market\nCommittee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.\n    The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly\nquarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury\nbond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which\nbanks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime\nlending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.\n    Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to\nthe April-June quarter, follow:\n    - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further\nagainst other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget\ndeficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after\nthe dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, the\neconomists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that\nthe dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.\n    - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue\ntrading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well\ntest the lower end of that range.\n    - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and\nprobably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong\nforeign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The\noutlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year\nsince both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.\n    - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator\nwill rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The\nsharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will\na mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.\n    - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct\nannual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at\nrespective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first\nand second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct\nannual\nrate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.\n    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees\nboth the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among\nthose surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct\nrate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this\nquarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.\n    \"The economy will bounce back more strongly than many\nexpect,\" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in\ninventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter\neconomic growth, with consumer spending helping later.\n    \"We're running out of special factors to keep the economy\nafloat,\" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His\ninterest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.\n    Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation\nhelped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.\nHe expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second\nquarter growth could be zero or negative.\n    Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer\nfrom a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow \ngovernment spending and less construction. Only a marginally\nnarrower trade deficit will add to growth.\n    He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,\nwith Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,\nrespectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for\nbonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.\n    Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly\nafter the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past\ndays and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.\n    David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc\nraised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20\npct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.\n    Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted\nhis forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point\nto eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and\nResler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.\n    The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese\ninvestors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear\nabout further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S.\ntrade sanctions.

ADVANCING","body":"Workers in China's rural\nfactories are struggling against a variety of problems to\nmaintain the momentum of progress since industrialisation of\nthe countryside began in the 1970s.\n    \"When I was a child, we had no bicycles. We went everywhere\non foot. The land here is salty, so the harvests were not good.\nMoney and food were inadequate. When it rained, the water\nleaked through the grass roof,\" said Li Wenxian, 31, of Hongshan\nin Zhejiang. Now he and other villagers live in large\ntwo-storey concrete homes with balconies and courtyards.\n    But still they face formidable difficulties. Many rural\nfactories are unable to get the raw materials they need, or\nelse they find they have become too expensive.\n    Gao Jianming, an official of Zhejiang's Rural Industry\ndepartment, said Zhejiang firms scour China for raw materials,\nwhich sometimes they barter for finished goods.\n    The People's Daily this month reported about 60 pct of\nChina's rural factories operate below capacity because of power\nshortages. It said many rural factories lose money because of\nthese problems and difficulties in getting credit, poor quality\nof goods and competition from larger state firms.\n    \"Electricity is short. In the busiest periods on the farms\nthe factories work three to four days a week so that\nagriculture can have all the power it needs. But more power is\navailable at night or on Sundays,\" Gao said.\n    Rural factories mostly operate outside official plans,\nwhich allocate raw materials under quota at cheap prices to\nstate firms. They have to compete on the open market for raw\nmaterials whose prices are driven up by demand.\n    Li said Hongshan does not suffer from power shortages only\nbecause its cement factory provides cheap cement to the\nelectricity supply department.\n    The raw materials of Hongshan's cement have to come\nhundreds of miles from central China by rail or canal, while\nits textile factories buy fabric from the far northeast.\n    The industrialisation of rural China began in the late\n1970s, a key part of top leader Deng Xiaoping's economic\nreforms. Deng wanted to harness the manpower of the\ncountryside, but keep it there and not draw it to the cities.\n    Hongshan set up factories and businesses because there was\nnot enough work on the land for its 3,700 people. Now just 120\nof its workers work full-time on the land. The rest work in 23\nfactories making cement, plastics and textiles.\n    The transformation of the rural economy is most noticeable\nalong the eastern seaboard where communications are good,\nlabour plentiful, land fertile and large markets nearby.\n    Gao said rural factories in Zhejiang now employ 25 pct of\nthe province's labour force. In 1985 such factories, for the\nfirst time, produced more in value than the province's farms.\n    \"The industrialising process is not over. When our farms are\nmore mechanised, and not many are now, more labour will become\navailable. There is a very big potential,\" Gao said.\n    Rural industry in Zhejiang has grown by more than 20 pct a\nyear since 1980, faster than any other sector of the economy.\n    Goods from Hongshan's factories are sold all over China.\n    Villager Li said when Hongshan started building factories\nin 1975 it was illegal, but local leaders approved it on\ncondition no state money was invested.\n    \"We borrowed money to start our cement factory and have\nrelied on our own resources since then,\" he said.\n    Another worker in a Hongshan tea-growing collective said\nbefore rural industrialisation there was no point in working\nhard, because most people earned the same.\n    \"The laziest in the commune used to laugh at those of us who\nworked more, but got the same,\" she said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"31-MAR-1987 02:24:52.49","places":["china"]},"11179":{"title":"JAPAN TO PAY FIVE PCT LESS FOR INDIAN IRON ORE","body":"Japan will pay five pct less for the\nIndian iron ore it imports in fiscal 1987/88 starting April 1\nthan the average 18 dlrs a tonne it paid in 1986/87, a\ngovernment trade official told Reuters.\n    He said India had agreed to export to Japan about 23 mln\ntonnes of iron ore in 1987/88, about the same as in the current\nyear.\n    The official described the agreement as satisfactory\noverall.

It imposed daily and weekly purchase\nlimits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets\nand stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of\ntotal buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This\nwill help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the\nworld's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.\n    The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer\nStock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.\n    A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was\nadopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting\ncountries agreed several changes to make the reference price\nmore responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions\nunder which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance\noperations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund\nbuffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature\nof the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running\ninto hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.\n    Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations\nin London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that\nagreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.\n    Consumers and a small group of producers argued that\n\"objective criteria\" should be used to define export quota\nshares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of\nBrazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain\nits previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,\nalthough an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,\ndelegates and trade sources see chances of any near term\nnegotiations on export quota distribution as remote.\n    International agreements exist for sugar and wheat.

Common fund for commodities, with a planned\ndirectly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to\nbecome operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet\nUnion has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the\nU.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,\nciting the lack of widespread support.\n    U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in\nKuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity\npact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to\nstudy individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented\ncommodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.\n    \"We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the\nprice of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,\"\nofficial Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently\nbelongs to only two international commodity agreements that\nhave economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement\n(ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat\npacts.\n    The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement\nbecause it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and\nnot designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,\nthe State Department said.

Malaysian Primary Industries Minister\nLim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, the\nworld's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its\nparticipation in international commodity pacts case by case.\n    Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing\nCountries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin.

We don't think agreements are the best\ninstrument to help developing countries. They were never meant\nto be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how\ndeveloping countries often interpret them.\"\n    Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of\ncommodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third\nWorld producing countries. But recently demands for more\nstringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the\nneed for \"intellectual honesty\" and \"objective criteria\" have\ngrown.\n    British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be\na two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.\n    It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct\nmarket participation through a buffer stock have a high degree\nof transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended\nborrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.\nDelegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to\nreflect changes in market structure and price trends rather\nthan dictate what prices should be.\n    A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price\nrealism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.\n    A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable\nto commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of\nsugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real\nmarket situation, particularly regarding stocks.\n    Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told\nReuters in Jakarta: \"These agreements can work as long as the\nproblems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there are\nstructural problems..But we are still committed to commodity\nagreements as an act of faith.\" Nicaraguan External Trade\nMinister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers\ncannot afford not to give their backing to commodity\nagreements.\n    \"The political will is not there on the part of some\nconsumers to make agreements work,\" Martinez Cuenca said.\n    The head of the economics department in the Brazilian\nForeign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an\nagreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market\nreality.

The\ncompany is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific\ntarget. Imports are currently very low.\n    - Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAM\nproduction by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is\nconsidering ways to boost imports, a company official said.\n    Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOT.N) to sell\nthe U.S. Firm's chips in Japan. The firms are planning a\njoint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai, northern\nJapan.\n    - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIET.T) will trim second\nquarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln\nchips compared to the first quarter. Plans call for increased\nimports but an official said \"boosting imports will be difficult\nas it depends on sales demand.\"\n    - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSU.T) will cut production in accord with\nMITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels.\n    - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIE.T) will reduce April\nproduction by 10 pct from March's 3.2 mln.

HIGHER","body":"Canada's airline industry, shaken up by\na recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for\ngovernment-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive\nfor profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said.\n    \"Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,\"\nsaid Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd.\n\"Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market.\"\n    The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr\ntakeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but\ncash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week\nas Canadian Airlines International Ltd.\n    Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the\n6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's\n50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine\npct.\n    Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and\ncost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true\npotential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four\ndecades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific\nLtd.\n    They said CP Air's management style had been not much\ndifferent from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because\nneither airline was held accountable to its owners.\n    \"Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these\ntwo airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither\nseemed that concerned about the bottom line,\" said Bradley.\n    \"But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very\nconscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air\nCanada is on the verge of going that way,\" he said.\n    CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than\nprofits, was \"a perennial money-loser,\" analyst Wilfred Hahn of\nBache Securities Inc said in a recent report.\n    Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated\nlong-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its\nlosses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs.\n    Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this\nyear in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on\nrevenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more\nthan 2 billion dlrs.\n    Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to\nthe public, the prospect of privatization at a time of\nincreased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more\nattention to finances, analysts said.\n    It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit \"in\nexcess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs\" for 1986. However, this profit\nrecovery was due less to management skill than the fact that\nall Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.\n    Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,\nattracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in\nVancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.\n    For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air\ntraffic growth, and they expect profits will come from\ncost-cutting and careful spending.\n    Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said\ninstitutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their\nportfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new\ncompetition makes profit growth less certain.\n    \"The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At\none time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody\nelse's,\" Friend said.\n    Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline\nshares for at least a year.\n    Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a\npublic stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes\nwithout setting off a political storm.\n    It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary\nupdating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.\n    Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,\nalready has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of\na dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie.\n    Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered\nsix commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would\nsoon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the\nBoeing Co.\n    Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,\nneeds to make fewer replacements and can afford these without\nhurting profits.\n    Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian\nAirlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8\nmln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"31-MAR-1987 12:55:50.41","topics":["earn"],"places":["canada"]},"11491":{"title":"U.S. DISTILLATE, GASOLINE INVENTORIES SEEN LOWER","body":"Tonight's American Petroleum Institute\nweekly inventory report is expected to show moderate drawdowns\nin distillates and gasoline stocks for the week ended March 27,\nanalysts and traders said.\n    They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln\nbarrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3\nand four mln barrels.\n    Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six\nmln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5\nmln barrels.

Around a third of\nany new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the\nJapanese.

The counterpart of\nimproving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or\nbecause the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods,\nmay be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget\ndeficit.\n   And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will\nhave less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the\ngap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S.\nBonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said.

The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a\ncharge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly in\nthe third quarter.\n    Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge\nresulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full\ncost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of\nChartered Accountants.\n    The company said it previously determined a write down of\nconventional oil and gas properties was not required at\nSeptember 30, under the previous method of calculating the\nlimitation of oil and gas values.\n    Dome said the most significant accounting change under the\nnew guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in\ncalculations instead of escalating price forecasts.\n    Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan preclude\nthe company from making an accurate estimate of future\nfinancing costs, which are used in the new accounting\ncalculations, it said.\n    As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10\npct discount factor in the calculations, which substantially\nconform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission, the company said.\n    Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural\ngas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71\nbillion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs.\n    Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas\noperating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion\ndlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue.\n    Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of\nDome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also\ncontributed to the decline, it said.\n    Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79\npct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985.\n    Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago\n542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0\nmln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs.\n    Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained\nat prior year's levels through new drilling activity and\nimprovements in productivity.\n    Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of\nlower domestic and export sales, it said.\n    Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled\n86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year.\n    Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a day\nfrom 591.0 mcf a day.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"31-MAR-1987 17:00:09.29","topics":["earn"],"places":["canada"]},"11712":{"title":"ITT <ITT>, ALCATEL SETTLE FINAL PAYMENTS","body":"ITT Corp said it received a final 400\nmln dlr payment for its telecommunications joint venture with\n<Alcatel NV>, settling all accounts in the venture.\n    The company had previously said it was due to receive the\n400 mln dlr payment.\n    Alcatel NV was formed last year when ITT and <Cie Generale\nd'Electricite> of France merged their telecommunications\nbusiness.

world will grow a sluggish 2.5 pct\nin 1987, a sharp drop from the more than three pct forecast six\nmonths ago, monetary sources said.\n    The forecasts, prepared by the IMF staff, will form the\nbasis of a debate on economic policy coordination by officials\nof top industrial nations at high-level meetings next week.\n    The sources said the IMF predicts an expansion of just 2.5\npct in the U.S., shaving a full one point off its original 1987\nforecast, released last fall.\n    The figures will be discussed by the IMF's executive board\nbefore going to the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee here\nnext week and may be subject to slight revision, they said.\n    The Reagan administration has forecast 3.2 pct U.S.\neconomic growth this year while more pessimistic Fed officials\nare predicting 2.5 to three pct.\n    The sources said the IMF also predicts growth of around \n2.5 pct in West Germany, and 2.8 pct in Japan.\n    Washington has extracted promises from both West Germany\nand Japan that they will take measures to bolster their\ndomestic economic growth, to help reduce the massive gap\nbetween their huge trade surpluses and the record American\ntrade deficit.\n    Poor economic growth figures in these two nations and the\nU.S. are likely to do little to reassure currency markets.\n    In recent days, the dollar has come under heavy selling\npressure as markets have grown cynical that Bonn and Tokyo will\ntake early action.\n    With no economic stimulus in sight, financial markets have\nreduced the dollar's value to levels that are more likely to\nbalance U.S. trade, monetary analysts say.\n    Monetary sources also said the IMF forecasts overall growth\nin developing nations of around three pct this year, with\ndeveloping countries in the western hemisphere -- the\nCaribbean, Central and South America -- expanding 3.3 pct.\n    In its recent annual report, the Inter-American Development\nBank said Latin American nations need to expand between four\nand five pct this year to service their 382 billion dlrs of\nforeign debt.\n    Non-oil exporting Third World nations should achieve an\nexpansion of around four per cent while oil exporting nations\nwill average almost no growth at all, the sources said.\n    Also short of the mark is the level of industrial country\ngrowth. Western officials maintain the industrial world needs\nto expand at least three per cent annually -- against this\nyear's initial IMF prediction of 2.5 pct -- in order to support\nthe export drive of debtor nations.\n    Exports provide the indebted world, which owes western\ncreditors some 900 billion dlrs, with its principal source of\nforeign exchange for debt repayments.\n    In other forecasts, the IMF put overall global growth at\nabout 2.8 pct and output in the seven leading industrial\nnations at around 2.5 pct.\n    The seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany,\nBritain, France, Italy and Canada -- have become the main forum\nfor coordination of medium-term economic policies in the\nindustrial world. The prediction for the seven is also around\n2.5 pct growth in 1987.\n    The Fund put Canadian growth at about 2.7 pct, the French\nexpansion at 2.9 pct and Britain at 2.8 pct.\n    The figures will be discussed as part of an overall debate\non the World Economic Outlook and the U.S. debt strategy by the\nInterim Committee.\n    Those talks are one of several meetings between top\neconomic officials of industrial and developing nations during\nthe semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"31-MAR-1987 17:44:46.90","organisations":["imf"],"places":["usa","uk","france","italy","canada","west-germany","japan"]},"11733":{"title":"SERVOTRONICS INC <SVT> YEAR NET","body":"Oper shr 50.4 cts vs 48.7 cts\n    Oper net 688,000 vs 665,000\n    Revs 12.3 mln vs 10.7 mln\n    Note: Oper excludes tax credits of 559,000 vs 537,000\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"31-MAR-1987 17:46:13.01","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"11734":{"title":"CURRENCY FUTURES CLIMB LIKELY TO BE CHECKED","body":"The surge in currency futures since\nFriday on the heels of the Reagan administration's proposed\ntariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in the\ncoming week, financial analysts said.\n    \"The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect it\nto last a little longer,\" said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst\nwith Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co.\n    Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of some\nmomentum today, is likely to continue, he said.\n    Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the\nadvance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said,\neven though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the\nJapanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention.\n    Treasury Secretary James Baker's comments that the G-6\nnations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with his\nrefusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a note\nof stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said.\n    Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner\nsaid G-6 central banks haven't yet shown the full force of\ntheir commitment to the Paris accord.\n    \"I'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the\nscenes,\" Horner said.\n    Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will\nfirm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures.\n    \"Coordinated, punishing intervention\" by the central banks\n-- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has\nonly smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according to\nHorner.\n    \"I think we're near the top of the range in the Europeans\n(currencies),\" he said.\n     On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, which\nset a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract,\nis at 0.007050, Horner said.\n    Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet to\npeak.\n    \"The basic trend in the currencies is higher,\" said Anne\nParker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers\nInc. \"The market wants to take the dollar lower.\"\n    Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a\nG-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the\nInternational Monetary Fund could make for choppy price\nactivity the remainder of the week, Mills said.\n    In addition, although the market shrugged off relatively\nhealthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators and\nfactory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger role\nin coming sessions, the analysts said.\n    Friday's employment statistics in particular will be\nclosely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of\n250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"31-MAR-1987 17:49:18.23","topics":["money-fx"],"places":["usa"]},"11735":{"title":"SKY EXPRESS <SKYX> PRESIDENT PLEADS GUILTY","body":"Sky Express Inc said its\npresident and chief operating officer, John Cerrito Sr, pleaded\nguilty to one charge of evading his personal income taxes in\n1983.\n    The company said a sentencing date has not yet been set.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"31-MAR-1987 17:49:37.06","places":["usa"]},"11736":{"title":"<POCO PETROLEUMS LTD> 1ST QTR JAN 31 NET","body":"Shr eight cts vs 30 cts\n    Net 1,100,000 vs 3,900,000\n    Revs 14.9 mln vs 20.7 mln\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"31-MAR-1987 17:55:24.25","topics":["earn"],"places":["canada"]},"11737":{"title":"TACO VILLA<TVLA> IN DEBT TALKS, MAY SELL ASSETS","body":"Taco Villa Inc said it is holding talks\nwith RepublicBank Corp <RPT> to restructure its loan payments\nand waive some financial convenants on its debt.\n    It also said it may sell certain assets to repay the bank\nborrowings, and is holding talks with interested parties.

Hutton and Co.\n    Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by\nChase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.\n    McCulley said that once the spread between three-month\ncertificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than\n1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime\nrate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.\n    However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they\nsee what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near\nterm, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to\nfollow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,\nthe last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks\nlifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount\nrate increase in April of that year.\n    Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since\nlast August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct\nshortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the\ncurrent 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.\n    \"The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There\nshould be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2\npct rate and others 7-3/4 pct,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G.\nLanston and Co.\n    Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's\nmeeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may\nwell foster higher interest rates soon.\n    Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy\nchange today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate\npressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat\nup or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.\n    \"The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to\ntighten policy when they did today's coupon pass,\" said Joseph\nLiro of S.G. Warburg and Co.\n    In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the\nFed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by\noffering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for\nits own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a \"pass.\"\n    \"The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy\nchange,\" said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter\nReynolds Inc. \n    She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the\nprime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153\nbasis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not\nreally narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate\nincrease.\n    The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise\n\"may have been less a response to interest rates than an\nattempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line.\"\n    Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to\ndeveloping countries, large money center banks with heavy\nexposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in\nan effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.\n    The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money\nto one another could help determine how many banks match the\nhigher prime rate and also how quickly they move.\n    In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of\nfunds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal\nfunds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly\n6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.  \n    The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting\ndemand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the\nclose of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five\nand 6-3/4 pct.\n    Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds\nrate probably will return to its recent trading level in the\n6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,\nbanks may not quickly boost their prime rates.\n    But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many\nthat the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to\nhelp the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"31-MAR-1987 18:27:52.91","topics":["interest"],"places":["usa"]},"11747":{"title":"COMPUTER AIDED <CADS>, MCDONNELL <MD> IN PACT","body":"Computer Aided Time Share\nInc said it has signed an agreement with McDonnell Douglas\nCorp's manufacturing and engineering systems unit under which\nit will market McDonnell's crossroads software package to\ndealers in 11 states in the upper Midwest.\n    Crossroads is McDonnell Douglas' personal computer-based\ncomputer aided design/drafting software package, it said.\n    Terms call for Computer Aided to buy a minimum of 500,000\ndlrs in software over the first 12 months beginning April one.\nIf Computer meets the commitment, McDonnell will not set up\nother regional distributors in the 12 months, it said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"31-MAR-1987 18:32:23.38","places":["usa"]},"11748":{"title":"TISCH BROTHERS LOWER TOSCO <TOS> STAKE","body":"An investment partnership led by\nfour sons of Loews Corp <LTR> Chairman Lawrence Tisch said it\ncut its Tosco Corp stake to the equivalent of 1,499,985 shares,\nor 4.95 pct of the total, from 1,666,650 shares, or 5.5 pct.\n    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nthe partnership, FLF Associates, said it sold 10,000 shares of\nSerier E convertible preferred stock on March 26 for 34.125\ndlrs each and 5,000 shares of preferred stock on March 27 at\n35.25 dlrs each.

But they would be given a much\ngreater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert\nHeller, who joined the board last August.\n    He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but\nargues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were\nadopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the\nvolatility of exchange rates.\n    Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of\ncommodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.\n    His idea, which many conservative economists find\nappealing, has some backing among board members appointed in\nrecent years by President Reagan.\n    It would complement the present system of opening or\nclosing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,\nkey indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of\nthe money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to\nchanges in interest rates and affect economic activity\ndirectly.\n    Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept\nis part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary\npolicy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid\nbase.\n    \"What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can\nserve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary\npurposes,\" says Heller.\n    In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States\nwent off the gold standard because the global economy had\nvastly outstripped gold supplies.\n    A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of\nhand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest\nproducers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa.\n    The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early\n1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.\n    But the current system of floating currencies in which\ncurrencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the\nmonetary system, is also being widely questioned.\n    Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a\nformal approach that mandates intervention by countries when\ncurrencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are\nmajor problems with this also.\n    For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries\nmight be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be\ndetrimental to their own domestic economy.\n    Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can\nmake much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree\nwith the fundamental judgement.\n    The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference\nto work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them\ncope with their overpowering debt problems.\n    Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's\nchief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called\nGroup of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a\nforum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other\neconomic matters.\n   He appears convinced that officials from West Germany,\nFrance, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind\nclosed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public\nposturing.\n   The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a\nprofound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and\ninternational exchange rates.\n    As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major\ncommodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together\nand prices would be measured on a regular basis.\n    \"In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might\nbe tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary\npolicy might be eased,\" he says.\n    He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction\nmarkets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a\nvirtually continuous basis.\n    Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and\ntraded on a world-wide basis, so \"that an index has a relevance\nfor the entire world,\" he says.\n    In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the\nproduction chain and serve as an imput into virtually all\nproduction processes.\n    \"Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive\nindicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures,\nthe monetary authorities may take such an index into account in\nmaking their monetary policy decisions,\" he says.\n    However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity\nsuch as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by\nthe OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system.\n    He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow\nmonetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity\nto the rest of the system and to other commodities.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"31-MAR-1987 18:48:13.83","topics":["money-fx"],"places":["usa"]},"11754":{"title":"MICROBIOLOGICAL

It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during\nthe two years.\n    \"We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the\nindustrialisation began,\" official Xu said. \"Since then, nearly\nall the families in the county have built new homes and many\nfactories have gone up.\"\n    \"Last year we lost land to a new railway line,\" Xu said. But\nland losses in future should fall because nearly all families\nalready have new houses, she added.\n    The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the\nPeking leadership, which announced earlier this month that\nChina will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land\nfor the first time this year.\n    \"The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully,\nwasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,\" said\nan article in the official press explaining the new measures.\n    \"It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,\" it\nsaid. \"China has a large population and its land resources are\nbadly deficient.\"\n    An official of the Shanghai city government said county\nauthorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of\narable land to other uses, while anything more than that must\nbe approved by the city government.\n   The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its\nefforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The\nprices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making\nit more profitable for them to grow other crops.\n    To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser\nand diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to\nbuy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to\nChina's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise\ngrain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.\n    Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the\nproblem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.\n    Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the\neastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too\nmuch to the demands of \"selfish city people\" and could raise city\ngrain prices without any problem.\n    But the government has ruled out a price rise. \"Raising the\nprice of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social\nstability,\" said a China Daily editorial this month.\n    The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the\nlong term. \"We must be very careful. We have a very large\npopulation which is used to price stability and will object to\nprice rises,\" he said. \"The problem is how to do it.\"\n    The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might\nalso affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with\ngrain and consumed by city residents.\n    In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate\ninvestment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.\n    The official press has reported that farmers fear farm\npolicy may change and they are putting their new wealth into\nbuilding graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.\n    Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign\ncontracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,\nbut they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.\n    \"As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at\nthe halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the\nfuture,\" the China Daily said in an editorial last month.\n    Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to\nuse the land but not own it. For most of the period of\nCommunist rule, the land was organised into collectives where\nthere was little room for individual initiative.\n    \"New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency\nof government policies and make them interested in long-term\ninvestment,\" the newspaper said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"31-MAR-1987 21:52:59.17","topics":["grain"],"places":["china"]},"11769":{"title":"CHINA OFFICIAL CONDEMNS GOVERNMENT GRAIN POLICY","body":"The grain output of a major Chinese\ngrain-producing province is not increasing, because farmers\nlack incentives, production costs are rising, storage\nfacilities are poor and there is not enough state investment in\ngrain, the province's vice-governor said.\n    The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui,\nas saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton as\nthey could growing grain, and three times as much growing cash\ncrops like flax.

They worry that\nthis could further reduce the industry's shrinking deposit\nbase.\n    This has given added urgency to bank moves to build up\ntheir capital market operations as Turkey's market-oriented\nPrime Minister Turgut Ozal liberalises the financial system.\n    Bankers said the 1986 recovery in earnings stemmed partly\nfrom foreign exchange operations and trade finance. But a\ngrowing volume of trading in government securities is now also\na major source of revenue for banks.\n    Bankers said the proportion of bank profits generated from\nthe traditional financing of commerce and industry is falling,\nand some have even been making a loss on these operations.\n    The major challenge to bank profits in Turkey came in 1980\nwhen the government, faced with its worst financial crisis in\n50 years, raised domestic interest rates sharply to fight an\ninflation rate of over 100 pct and launched an export drive.\n    Deniz Gokce, associate professor of economics at the\nBosphorus University, told Reuters that banks were forced to\npay depositors real interest rates for the first time and\nprofits started to fall. Previously, rates had been below\ninflation.\n    Turkey's domestic banks also partly missed out on the\nexport drive as foreign banks moved into Istanbul and reaped\nthe benefits of trade finance with their added expertise. The\nnumber of foreign banks has risen to 16 from just two in 1981.\n    Although local banks tried to follow suit, Turkey's exports\ndeclined last year to 7.4 billion dlrs from 7.9 billion in 1985\nand bankers doubt there is enough business to go round.\n    As a result banks, including a few foreign operations, have\nstarted moving into capital market operations to broaden their\nearnings base and take advantage of the relaunch just over a\nyear ago of the Istanbul Stock Exchange.\n    \"When we saw that there was a demand and supply of money\noutside the banking system, we could not envisage ourselves\nexcluded from these transactions,\" said Osman Erk, deputy\ngeneral manager of the private bank Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi AS.\n    The number of banks active at the exchange, mainly trading\ngovernment securities, went up to 28 this year from 23 when the\nmarket was revived in December 1985.\n    Liberalisation went one step further last week when\nparliament passed a law encouraging companies to go public.\nLast month, Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi launched the country's first\ncommercial paper programme, for a joint-venture chemical firm.\n    Medium-sized private Pamukbank AS announced a strong\nrecovery in 1986 pre-tax profit to 12.9 billion lira from 603\nmln in 1985, while Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi profits increased to\n30.6 billion lira from 6.1 billion.

Some traders and analysts expect limit declines in\nnearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle.\n    University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,\"The\nreport shows that hog producers have responded to a very\ndesirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10\nmonths.\"\n    Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futures\nprices are above producers' break even points. Even if futures\nfell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could still\nlock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavy\nselling pressure today.\n    \"We have not had a period of profitability of this\nmagnitude since last summer,\" Levitt said. \"In fact, hog\noperations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have been\nso profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get back\non their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hog\noperation alone.\"\n    Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also was\nnegative, in that some lead time was anticipated before the\nslaughter increased from the previous year.\n    We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but we\ndidn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-state\nspring report, Levitt added.\n    High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn that\ncould be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increased\nprofits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations to\nincrease production starting late last year.\n    Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hog\nherd resulted from a revision of the December report and\nwithout the revision, the March report might have been very\nclose to average expectations.\n    Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a major\nupward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breeding\nherd in the December 1 report.
