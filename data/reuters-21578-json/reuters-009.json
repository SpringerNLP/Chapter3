Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in\nhigher-producing delta areas.\n    Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's\n2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.\n    U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in\n1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has\nsteadily declined in the 1980's.\n    U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in\nthe low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The\nhighest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has\nkept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln\nacres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.\n    Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields\naveraging 119.3 bushels per acre.\n    \"We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion\nbushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so,\" an analyst said.\n    Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as\nlong as government program provisions remain the same, analysts\nsaid.\n    Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to\nset aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible\nfor payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15\npct of their acreage.\n    \"To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to\nprovide more incentives,\" an analyst said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"24-MAR-1987 17:10:19.66","topics":["grain","corn","oilseed","soybean"],"places":["usa"]},"9059":{"title":"KIRSCHNER <KMDC> COMPLETES PURCHASE","body":"Kirschner Medical corp said it\ncompleted the acquisition of Minnesota Mining and\nManufacturing's <MMM> orthopedic metal implant line division.\n    The acquisition price is 12.0 mln dlrs in cash, a six mln\ndlr three year note and 100,000 shares of Kirschner common\nstock.\n    The division had sales of 11.3 mln dlrs in 1986.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"24-MAR-1987 17:10:32.59","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"9060":{"title":"U.S. SENATORS SEEK TO EXPAND USDA EXPORT BONUS","body":"Leading U.S. farm state senators are\nseeking to insert into the Senate's omnibus trade bill a\nprovision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the\nU.S. Agriculture Department's export enhancement program, EEP,\nto include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products, including\nthe Soviet Union, Senate staff said.\n    Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies to\nrecoup export markets lost to competing nations' unfair trading\npractices.\n    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)\nis leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to\nbroaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be\neligible for the subsidies, sources said.\n    The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee Chairman\nLloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.), David Pryor\n(D-Ark.), John Melcher (D-Mont.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) --\nalso may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork\nproducers and processors from Canadian imports.\n    The measure, sponsored by Sen.

There's not\nmuch that's off the table in terms of creative thinking\" about\nways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University\nof Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.\n    The retail car market is \"much more freeform now\" than it\nwas in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit\nanalyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.\n    Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.\nDealerships sold one kind of car--a \"Chevy\" or a Ford or a\nStudebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold\n738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National\nAutomobile Dealers Association.\n    That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen\nBeatle--began to gain popularity. The \"Bug\" caused \"a\nrebellion\" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from\nrestrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,\nsays Jauppi.\n    One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has\nbeen in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,\nthe average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold\nincrease from 1956--and employed 34 workers.\n    \"I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln\ndlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,\"\nsays Cole.\n    \"There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that\nmake cars,\" he says.\n    With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying\nup other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend\nwill let up.\n    Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.\nPower, a California-based market research firm, says that, by\n1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800\nprincipal owners today.\n    Many dealers are experimenting with owning several\nfranchises, some of which might compete against each other. \"It\nused to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a\nChevrolet dealer might handle several lines,\" Jauppi says.\n    As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about\nthe possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned\nor open international operations.\n    Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,\n\"are obviously thinking of very seriously,\" says Cole.\n    Although some say the franchise system might get in the way\nof a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to\ntrading in car dealer shares.\n    \"Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing\nthe manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those\ncars. It could happen any time,\" Jauppi says.\n    \"If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the\nscale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to\nresist taking them public,\" said another analyst.\n    And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become\ninternational.\n    \"We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks\nthat are worldwide,\" he says.

But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based\nbanks are boosting their treasury operations in London.\n    As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade\nfinance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain\nran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K.\nClearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.\n    The two major Bahrain-based international banks, <Arab\nBanking Corp> and <Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased\ntheir presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading\nrepresentative offices to branch status to allow dealing.\n    One economist said: \"It is cheaper to run a riyal book in\nLondon than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain...\nThere is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London.\"\n    Jeddah-based <Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit\ntaker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia,\n<National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November\n1986.\n    The major market maker has traditionally been London-based\nconsortium bank <Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom\njoint-venture <Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its\nLondon operation to deposit taker status in mid-February.\n    One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: \"Inevitably the\nvolume of business in London has gained pace with the two new\nlicences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most\nof the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.\"\n    Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi\nriyal market is difficult to quantify.\n    Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency\ndeposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped\nto the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986\nfrom 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.\n    The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal\ntrading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very\nquiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now\nstaff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect\n<Arab National Bank> to step up London operations.\n    Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market\nmoving completely out of the region, partly because of local\ndemand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian\nMonetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderate\ninternationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue\nspeculation.\n    There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market\nshifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain\nand London is still limited.\n    But for the first time since the formation of the six\nnation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs\nthat a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.\n    Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final\ncurrency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia,\nKuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n    But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary\nSystem style with a common peg have been discussed at high\nlevel and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expected\nto be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year.\n    One dealer said: \"A lot of exposure is being given to\ndiscussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the\nend a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.\"\n    One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.\n    The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated\nsince the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently\nlinked to a basket of currencies while the other five\ncurrencies are either officially or in practice linked to the\nU.S. Dollar.\n    Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation\nagainst the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies,\nbut plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of\n7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.\n    Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued\nslide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the\nundermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"25-MAR-1987 05:00:56.31","topics":["money-fx","saudriyal"],"places":["bahrain","uk","saudi-arabia"]},"9171":{"title":"BELGOLUX TRADE SWINGS INTO JANUARY DEFICIT","body":"The Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union\nrecorded a provisional trade deficit of 9.45 billion francs in\nJanuary after a December surplus of 15.32 billion francs,\nrevised upwards from a provisional surplus of 11.94 billion,\nthe National Statistics Office said.\n    In January 1986, the union recorded a deficit of 23.31\nbillion francs.\n    January imports fell to a provisional 228.86 billion francs\nfrom 240.24 billion in December and 281.65 billion a year\nearlier, but exports were also lower, at 219.41 billion francs\nagainst 255.56 billion and 258.34 billion respectively.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"25-MAR-1987 05:02:55.15","topics":["trade"],"places":["belgium","luxembourg"]},"9172":{"title":"GUINNESS SEEKS U.K. INJUNCTION AGAINST SAUNDERS","body":"Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> will seek an\ninjunction in the U.K. High Court today to freeze the assets of\nformer Chairman Ernest Saunders in its attempts to recover 5.2\nmln stg paid to a Jersey company as part of the company's\ntakeover battle for <Distillers Co Plc>, a spokesman said.\n    He said the court move aimed to freeze Saunders' assets up\nto the value of the sum it wanted to recover.

use of\ninterest rate swaps, which are now arranged for most new issues\nin the eurobond markets, traders and analysts said.\n    Indeed, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all\nnew debt issued here last year -- over 186 billion dlrs worth\n-- was part of either an interest rate or currency swap.\n    \"The U.S. Treasuries market here is swap-driven,\" said David\nJones, vice president at Goldman Sachs and Co international and\nhead of its U.S. Government bond trading desk.\n    \"It is commonplace to have trades of 100 mln dlrs or more in\n10-years, seven years or five years, all related to an interest\nrate swap or hedging of a eurobond deal,\" Jones said at a recent\nconference on the U.S. Treasuries market.\n    Just a year or so ago, he said, trades of that size going\nthrough brokers screens in London were unthinkable.\n    Traders said that over the past two weeks, while trading in\nU.S. Treasuries has been almost frozen by indecision over the\ndirection of interest rates, swap-related deals have provided\nthe sole source of new business.\n    Dealers said that last week, a 260 mln dlr trade involving\ntwo and 10-year Treasuries was transacted on brokers' screens.\n    The trade, they said, was swap related.\n    There are no firm figures on exactly how much U.S. Treasury\ndebt is traded here and estimates vary widely.\n    But Wrightson Economics, a U.S.-based research firm which\ndrew its data from U.S. Treasury reports, estimated that gross\ntransactions in U.S. Government securities in London rose to\n341 billion dlrs in the first nine months of 1986 alone,\nagainst 188 billion in all of 1985.\n    Wrightson estimates that about 20 pct of all U.S. Treasury\ntrading is transacted outside the U.S., With Tokyo forming the\nthird major centre.\n    And while figures are not yet available for the last\nquarter, the anecdotal evidence suggests that the trend\ncontinued, traders say.\n    Richard Lacy, chief executive at Exco International, put\naverage daily Treasuries trading volume in London at about 15\nbillion dlrs. Exco recently purchased an 80 pct interest in RMJ\nSecurities inc, one of the four major brokers in U.S.\nGovernment bonds which has offices in London, New York and\nTokyo.\n    But Dick Van Splinter, president of RMJ's competitor,\nFundamental Brokers Inc's London operations, estimates average\ndaily turnover is no more than four to five billion dlrs.\n    But even at the low range of estimates, Treasuries trading\nvolume is at least equal to that in the U.K.'s own government\nbonds, known as gilts.\n     Jeremy Ford, vice president at Bankers Trust International\nLtd, explained that U.S. Treasuries are used by intermediaries\nin swap transactions to lock in the \"spread,\" the difference\nbetween the interest rate the borrower has to pay and the rate\nthat the counterparty is obliged to pay.\n    But even beyond swap-related activity, dealers said the\nnature of trading in London has changed.\n    \"The interesting thing our figures show is the transition in\nLondon from a marketing effort to a trading effort,\" said Louis\nCrandall, an economist at Wrightson who has been collecting the\ndata.\n    Crandall said that previously, firms' activities were\nlimited to trying to sell U.S. Securities to European\ninvestors. Now, however, they appear increasingly willing act\nas principal in transactions rather than acting on behalf of\ntheir New York offices.\n    Increasingly, traders say, firms maintain separate profit\nand loss sheets for their London operations so that trading\ndecisions can be made independently from the U.S. Headquarters.\n    Many of the major U.S. Firms, including Merrill Lynch and\nCo, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc and Chemical Bank trade for\ntheir own accounts here.\n    Also, traders point out, the number of U.S. Firms operating\nin London has increased sharply over the past year, as has the\nnumber of European and Asian banks which trade U.S. Government\nsecurities.\n    Within the past few months, National\nWestminster Bank Plc's County Bank subsidiary and Swiss Bank\nCorp have applied to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to\nbecome primary dealers in U.S. Government securities and their\nLondon offices have just recently received direct-dealing\nbrokers screens.\n    And Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, already a primary dealer, is\npreparing to open a U.S. Treasuries trading desk in London.\n    Dick Van Splinter, president of Fundamental Brokers Inc,\nthe largest of the four major government bond brokers here,\nsaid he now has 45 firms using direct-dealing screens, up from\n35 a year ago.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"25-MAR-1987 08:34:10.95","places":["uk","usa"]},"9245":{"title":"MATSUSHITA TO ISSUE 200 BILLION YEN CONVERTIBLE","body":"Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd\n<MC.T> said it will issue a 200 billion yen unsecured\nconvertible bond in the domestic capital market through public\nplacement with Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd, Nomura Securities Co\nLtd, Nikko Securities Co Ltd, Daiwa Securities Co Ltd and\nNational Securities Co Ltd as underwriters.\n    Coupon and conversion price for the par-priced bond\nmaturing on September 30, 1996, will be set before payment on\nMay 2.\n    This issue equals in size a record one by Toyota Motor Corp\nlast December.\n    Matsushita's shares closed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange at\n1,640 yen, down 50 from yesterday.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"25-MAR-1987 08:36:41.34","places":["japan"]},"9246":{"title":"DIXONS GETS ONLY 20 PCT OF CYCLOPS <CYL> IN BID","body":"<Dixons Group PLC> said only about\n852,000 shares of Cyclops Corp common stock, or 20 pct on a\nfully diluted basis, were tendered and not withdrawn under its\nbid for all shares that expired yesterday, but the companmy has\nstill decided to accept all shares validly tendered.\n    The company said it now has about 22 pct ownership of\nCyclops on a fully diluted basis and expects to proceeds toward\ncompletion of its proposed acquisition of Cyclops.\n    Last week, before extending its Cyclops offer for one week\nat the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nDixons had reported that 54 pct of Cyclops' stock had been\ntendered in response to its 90.25 dlrs per share offer which\nexpired at 2400 EST yesterday.\n    Yesterday, CAYACQ Corp dropped certain conditions of its\n92.50 dlrs a share offer for Cyclops and firmed up the\nfinancing for the proposed transaction.

It matures on April 8,\n1992. The bond and warrants will be listed in Frankfurt.\n    If all participation share warrants are exercised, the\ncompany will obtain some 300 mln marks in new equity.\n    The construction allows Inspectorate to borrow at lower\ncost than a comparable convertible bond and will give the\nInspectorate equity through issues of participation\ncertificates in West Germany, a Swiss Bank Corp spokesman said.\n    Inspectorate requires funding to finance its purchase of a\n51 pct stake in Harpener AG, a diversified West German group,\nand other recent acquisitions.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"25-MAR-1987 09:34:52.92","places":["west-germany"]},"9282":{"title":" Bundesbank buys dollars for yen - Frankfurt dealers\n","date":"25-MAR-1987 09:35:22.27","topics":["money-fx","dlr"]},"9283":{"title":"REUTERS TO BUY I P SHARP OF CANADA","body":"Reuters Holdings Plc <RTRS.L> said it\nhad agreed in principle to buy <I P Sharp Associates Ltd> of\nToronto for 30.4 mln stg.\n    Sharp is a time-sharing network and database company\nspecialising in finance, economics, energy and aviation.

It was estimated that if\noil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that\ncould cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.\n    - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It\nwould raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000\nbarrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.\n    - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical\nexpenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a\nday, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.\n    - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to\nspur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for\nthe typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower\nthe cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.\n    Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration\nproposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut\nthe need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.\n    He also called again for Congressional approval to explore\noff the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion\nbarrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which\nmay hold nine billion barrels.\n    Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to \namend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these\nproposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security\nstudy would make a strong case for the need to help the\nstruggling domestic oil industry.\n    Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even\nthough it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to\nraise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to\n100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.\n    This, he said, would further bolster national security in\ncase of an oil-supply disruption.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"25-MAR-1987 12:53:09.36","topics":["crude","nat-gas"],"places":["usa"]},"9437":{"title":"TODD SHIPYARDS <TOD> OMITS COMMMON DIVIDEND","body":"Todd Shipyards Corp said it\nomitted payment of the quarterly dividend on its common stock\nand lowered the dividend on its series A preferred stock to 75\ncts from 77 cts a share.\n    Todd said the 75 ct preferred dividend will be paid May one\nto shareholders of record April 15.\n    The company said it omitted the common dividend to cover\nboth losses from a commercial ship conversion contract and\nincreased reserves for previously announced discontinued\nshipyard operations.\n    In addition, the company said its lenders agreed to\ntemporarily reduce the net worth requirement of its revolving\ncredit and term-loan pact to 140 mln dlrs from 130 mln.\n    The reduction will hold through May 15, it said.\n    Todd said the reduction in the net worth requirement\nallowed for the payment of the preferred dividend and prevented\nit from violating covenants of its credit agreement.\n    The company said it is also negotiating with its lenders to\nextend the reduced net worth terms beyond May 15.\n    Todd added that it has suffered financially because of the\nU.S. Navy's unwillingness to release certain retentions under\ncompleted ship construction contracts and a general decrease in\nU.S. military spending.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"25-MAR-1987 12:53:59.89","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"9438":{"title":"IMO DELAVAL <IMD> SETS INITIAL DIVIDEND","body":"Imo Delaval said its board\ndeclared an initial quarterly dividend of 14 cts per share,\npayable April 24 to holders of record on April 6.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"25-MAR-1987 12:56:27.95","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"9439":{"title":"FED TO PURCHASE TREASURY BILLS FOR A CUSTOMER","body":"The Federal Reserve will purchase\napproximately one billion dlrs of U.S. Treasury bills for a\ncustomer after the Treasury's auction of four-year notes, a Fed\nspokesman said.\n    The spokesman said the Fed intends to purchase bills\nmaturing in up to six months.\n    Dealers said Federal funds were trading at 6-3/16 pct when\nthe Fed announced the operation.

Huckaby, chairman\nof the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar\nissues, told Reuters in an interview.\n    Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year\nthey must halt production increases, said he will deliver the\nsame message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also\nsaid he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.\n    Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic\nsweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further\ncuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.\n    \"I think if we're talking about dropping (the quota)\nanother half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point\nwhere the program might not work,\" he said.\n    \"Ideally, I'd like to freeze things right where we are,\"\nsaid Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.\n    A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the\ncurrent level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the\nU.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports\nholding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.\n    A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made\nuntil 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.\n    \"I feel like if we didn't expand production, we could\nprobably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through\nthe 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),\"\nHuckaby said.\n    However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup\nproducers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener\nmarket from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.\n    He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will\ncapture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in\nthe U.S.\n    But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the\nproduction of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further\nexpanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports\nmight be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.\n    Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner\ncompanies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.\n    \"This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have\nsome natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the\nprogram is preserved,\" Huckaby said.\n    Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to\nthink about how domestic output could be controlled, either\nthrough production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.\n    Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the\nJustice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask\ncorn refiners to limit production.\n    \"I don't know if we will go this route, but if we do\nthere's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do\nthat legally?\" he said.\n    Asked if he would proceed with production controls without\nthe support of corn refiners, Huckaby said \"You build a fragile\nhouse if you do it that way.\"\n    Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers\nhave expanded production, because high sugar price support\nmeans returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such\nas soybeans and grain.\n    But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would\nnot be good policy.\n    Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to\nsugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they\nmay be penalized retroactively under any production control\nlegislation passed next year.\n    Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in\nthe sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration\nproposal to drastically slash the program.\n    \"The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don't\nthink it will get up a head of steam,\" Huckaby said.\n    He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price\nsupport is unlikely to be approved.\n    Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program,\nHuckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint\nwith the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the\nEuropean Community's sugar policy.

rental cars may be its downfall, analysts said.\n    Digesting its acquisitions of hotels, Pan Am Corp's Pacific\nair routes, and Hertz rental cars, combined with stiff air fare\ncompetition has left the company with an undervalued stock\nprice, analysts said.\n    The vulnerability of UAL's stock has fueled takeover\nspeculation, as have reports that real estate magnate Donald\nTrump has bought a large amount of its stock.\n    Today, a UAL executive told Reuters its chairman Richard\nFerris spoke with Trump last week. Trump said his interest in\nthe stock was as an investment, but the executive said the\ncompany does not know how much Trump owns or whether he has any\nother plans.\n    UAL senior vice president Kurt Stocker said the company\nbelieves its diversification strategy will work since it can\nfeed customers from one business to another. Several weeks ago,\nit announced the new name of Allegis, to be taken in May.\n    \"The strategy that Dick Ferris was talking about a couple\nweeks ago when we announced the Allegis name is that the whole\nreally ends up to be worth more than the sum of the parts.\nUnfortunately, some people haven't really come to this\nunderstanding,\" Stocker said.\n    But those same parts - Westin Hotels, Hertz rental cars,\nUnited Airlines and its reservation system - also has Wall\nStreet calculating a wide range of breakup values from about\n100 dlrs per share to 130 dlrs per share.\n    Analysts aren't so sure the strategy is going to work. They\nmention Transworld Corp, initially Trans World Airlines,\nas an example of an airline diversification gone wrong.\nTransworld Corp ended up spinning off its TWA airline.\nTransworld, now TW Services, is selling Hilton International to\nUAL.\n    \"If you want to be negatively biased you say it's a stupid\nphilosophy, and if you're United and you put billions of dlrs\ninto other acquisitions, this is a good idea. There's not much\nevidence one way or the other,\" said Dean Witter analyst Mark\nDaugherty.\n    \"In the short or long run, they all (UAL's businesses) make\nmoney and perform well,\" said Stocker. He said the stock price\nhasn't caught on since the strategy is relatively new.\n    Analysts say it's because earnings are relatively poor.\nEarnings last year were 25 cts per share. Louis Marckesano of\nJanney Montgomery predicts 1987 net of 3.50 dlrs per share.\n    \"They're potential is enormous. I think their problem has\nbeen execution. The strike was the single biggest factor that\nset them back in 1985. Last year, the whole industry was\ninvolved in fare wars. They were hit harder by the fare wars\nthan anyone else,\" said Marckesano.\n    Marckesano said United Airlines was particularly hurt by\nthe fare wars because it shares a Denver hub with Texas Air\nCorp's price-slashing Continental Airlines.\n    Analysts said the same strategy which has contributed to an\nundervalued stock price may also result in a strong takeover\ndefense. They said UAL paid a lot for some of its assets and\nthat in itself may make the company undesireable.\n    \"I think they have a fairly tough management that will at\nleast be able to do battle with a potential shark and may well\nbe able to defeat them.

Cocaine, although illegal, is Bolivia's largest export.\n    The campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal crops\ninstead of coca would be financed instead using local currency,\nNogales said.\n    Because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some four\npct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increased\nto pay for the drug-eradication drive without too much of n\nimpact on inflation, he added.\n    Nogales said he does not expect Bolivia's debt repurchase\nto become a model for other debtors in dire straits. \"We're not\nseeking a universal solution,\" he said.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"25-MAR-1987 16:33:17.94","places":["usa","bolivia"]},"9592":{"title":"BRAZIL WANTS TO INCREASE STEEL EXPORTS TO U.S.","body":"Brazil wants to increase its\nsteel exports to the United States, now limited because of\ntough import restraints set in 1984 by the Reagan\nadministration, a spokeswoman for the Brazilian Steel Institute\n(IBS) said.\n    Brazilian and U.S. Trade officials held the first of a\nthree-day meeting today in Brasilia to discuss the issue.\n    In 1984, after three months of painstaking negotiations,\nthe U.S. Government reached accords with seven steel-exporting\nnations - Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Spain, South Africa\nand South Korea - to reduce their shipments to the United\nStates by about 30 pct in 1985.\n    The 1984 restraints established that for 1987 Brazil's\nsteel exports to the U.S. Could not exceed 632,000 tonnes,\nincreasing to 640,000 tonnes in 1988 and 670,000 tonnes in\n1989, the last of the five-year deadline set by the agreements.\n    Brazilian officials are trying to increase Brazil's export\nshare of non-flat products to the U.S. Market.\n    The spokeswoman said there were reports of domestic supply\nproblems in the United States.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"25-MAR-1987 16:34:09.06","topics":["trade","iron-steel"],"places":["usa","brazil"]},"9593":{"title":"XYLOGICS IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING","body":"Xylogics Inc is making an initial\npublic offering of 1,089,300 shares of common stock at 16 dlrs\na share, co-managing underwriters Salomon Brothers Inc and\nCowen and Co said.\n    Of the shares being offered, 750,000 are being sold by the\ncompany and the rest by selling shareholders.

The GAO then decided to\nre-examine the costs, sources said.\n    The issue is an important one, because congressional budget\ncommittees are known to be considering limiting the use of\ncertificates as a means of cutting spending.\n    Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior\nAssociate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the\nSenate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.\n    Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are\nuncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared\nto cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp,\nCCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.\n    USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents\nto store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in\ngovernment storage.\n    It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigative\narm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the\ngovernment more to use certificates instead of cash in farm\nprice and income support programs, Reagan administration\nsources said.\n    The GAO is expected to point out that use of\npayment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight\nstorage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been\nsold.\n    The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director\nBrian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees\nintensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal\nbudget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of\nPIK certificates.\n    The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or\ncerts, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to\nfarmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to\nrepay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or\ncash.\n    Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion\ndlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another\n6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and\nAugust 1987, according to USDA.\n    Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily\nbecause recipients can use the certificates to pay back\ngovernment loans at levels below the loan rate.\n    Eliminating this practice, called \"PIK and roll,\" would save\nthe government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to\nthe Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according\nto a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates\ncost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.\n    The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be\nconsidering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other\nsavings alternatives.\n    The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the\nestimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date\nhave cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln\ndlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one\nadministration official said.\n    However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates\nbased in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.\n    The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable\nto the different effect certificates can have on market prices\nover the course of a crop year.\n    USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has found\nthat between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of\ncorn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by\nbetween 35 and 45 cents per bushel.\n    Between September and November, however, certificates had\nonly a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS\nstudy, obtained by Reuters.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"25-MAR-1987 18:44:58.85","topics":["grain","corn"],"places":["usa"]},"9668":{"title":"DAILY TELEGRAPH IN DEAL WITH NEWS INTERNATIONAL","body":"<Hollinger Inc> said 58 pct-owned <The\nDaily Telegraph PLC>, of London, agreed to form a joint venture\nprinting company in Manchester, England with <News\nInternational PLC>.

Tokyo was last laid flat in 1923 by a tremor reading\n7.8, raising the spectre of another within five years.\n    Seismic experts at Shizuoka, one of three areas near Tokyo\nconsidered quake-prone, say they expect a major earthquake\nwithin the next few years.\n    Added to such fears is the fact that no developed nation\nhas suffered a major quake since the far-reaching changes in\nthe last two decades which have bound the global economy into a\ncomplex, fragile, interdependent financial network.\n    \"We are reaching a dangerous time. Insurance companies are\nstarting to worry about how to cover the large losses,\" said\nHatsuho Narita, a manager at the British Insurance Group.\n    \"It's a theme that has worried a lot of people. It's\ndifficult to put a figure on it, but the impact on all world\nmarkets would be considerable,\" Brian Waterhouse, a banking\nexpert at brokerage James Capel in Tokyo, told Reuters.\n    What would happen?\n    Consider that Tokyo and its six surrounding prefectures\naccount for up to 40 pct of Japanese gross national product, or\nsome six pct of world GNP.\n    Some economists believe that in the immediate aftermath of\na Tokyo quake, the yen would rise against sterling because of\nthe large amount of reinsurance which would fall due in London.\nBut it would plunge against other currencies.\n    This would worsen the dramatic loss of value in land and\nassets in the Tokyo area. Banks would be left holding hundreds\nof billions of dollars in worthless mortgages and loans.\n    Bankers estimate that 50 to 70 pct of city and regional\nbanks' loan exposure is to smaller business, which would most\nlikely lose all in a quake. Up to nine pct of their exposure is\nin housing and consumer loans, they said.\n    Many smaller banks and some larger ones would go to the\nwall, bankers polled by Reuters said.\n    The government, aware that insurance claims would be huge,\nhas set a payout ceiling of 10 mln yen per private house. In\nTokyo, 100 mln yen buys only a very modest residence.\n    In addition, the insurance industry has formed the Japan\nEarthquake Reinsurance Co to cover housing to a total of 10\nbillion dlrs, 80 pct of it government-guaranteed.\n    However, insurers said the industrial sector, which has no\ngovernment backing, is a more dangerous risk.\n    Japanese insurers said they are finding it increasingly\ndifficult to find reinsurance abroad.\n    \"Overseas firms are now very alert to earthquake insurance\nrisks,\" said Tahashi Kumakiri, Foreign Department head at the\nJapan Non-life Insurance Association.\n    Due to limited world insurance capacity, the Finance\nMinistry recommends a coverage limit of 15 to 30 pct of\nJapanese firms' total insurable value.\n    Even so, one insurer believes that local firms reinsure up\nto 80 pct of their quake cover overseas, most of it through\nLloyds of London.\n    Some of this reinsurance is then reinsured again,\ncompounding the risks should the money suddenly be called in.\n    Foreign entities in Japan are allowed 100 pct quake cover\nbut foreign insurers now set a limit of 60 pct.\n    Industrial cover is confidential but official figures show\nthat in fiscal 1985/86 ended March 31, Japan did about half a\nbillion dlrs of overseas reinsurance business in fire cover,\nmost of which is quake-related.\n    Bankers said the destruction of underlying assets and\nrepatriation of huge amounts of Japanese overseas investment\nwould seriously affect overseas stock and bond markets.\n    Japanese institutions buy a net 10 billion dlrs or so of\nforeign bonds a month, much of it U.S. Treasuries, and are\npurchasing more and more U.S. And European stocks. The value of\nforeign holdings of Japanese securities would nosedive.\n    Japan would need huge amounts of money over a long period\nto rebuild, which would block out developing nation creditors\nfrom existing capital resources, the bankers said.\n    Loss of central computers would mean billions in lost\ntransactions, bankers noted.\n    Oil traders said crude prices would plummet as imports fell\nby up to half from some three mln barrels per day now.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"26-MAR-1987 02:50:02.12","places":["japan"]},"9723":{"title":"Hoechst AG 1986 world group pretax profit 3.21 billion marks vs 3.16 billion\n","date":"26-MAR-1987 02:50:21.33","topics":["earn"]},"9724":{"title":"AIDC ISSUES FIRST AUSTRALIAN DLR MEDIUM TERM NOTES","body":"The Australian Industry Development\nCorp (AIDC) said it issued 20 mln Australian dlrs of five-year\nnotes in London.\n    The notes, issued in denominations of 50,000 dlrs, were\npart of a 10-year, one billion U.S. Dlr multicurrency facility\nestablished last December, it said in a statement.\n    Medium-term Euronotes had previously only been issued in\nU.S. Dlrs, it said.\n    The AIDC last week said it issued under the same facility\nthe first of several five mln Australian dlr-denominated\nEuro-commercial paper tranches in Asia.\n    Dealers for the one billion U.S. Dlr borrowing program were\nthe AIDC, <Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd>, <Merrill Lynch\nInternational and Co>, <Morgan Stanley International>, <Salomon\nBrothers International Ltd> and <Swiss Bank Corp International\nLtd>, the AIDC said.\n    <Citibank N.A.> was the issuing and paying agent.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"26-MAR-1987 02:56:13.45","places":["australia"]},"9725":{"title":"MAZDA DOES NOT PLAN TO MAKE SPORTS CARS IN U.S.","body":"Mazda Motor Corp <MAZT.T> has no plans to\nproduce sports cars in the U.S., A company spokesman said.\n    A Japanese daily paper said Mazda would switch production\nof its RX-7 sports car, which is popular in the U.S., To the\nU.S. Over the next three years to minimise losses caused by the\nyen's rise against the dollar.\n    Mazda's wholly owned subsidiary <Mazda Motor Manufacturing\n(USA) Corp> (MMUC) in Flatrock, Michigan, is due to start\nproducing Mazda 626 saloon cars from September at an annual\nrate of 240,000, the company said on March 2.\n    One of Ford Motor Co's <F> Japanese distributors, <Autorama\nInc>, said recently it was considering importing the\nMMUC-manufactured cars.

The\ncompany said it was in the course of arranging these\nfacilities.\n    BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group's\ninvestment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full\nownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be\nmade without the limitations of a minority interest.\n    BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum\nuse of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices\nwere likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the\ninvestment.\n    Walters added that it also felt that, due to management\nchanges in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even\nin a lower oil price environment.\n    Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs\nand in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before\ntax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.\n    Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.\nOne noted that it was not immediately clear why the group\nshould spend so much money buying a company it already\ncontrolled.\n    BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard\nshares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.\n    It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on\nthe U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to\ndispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the\n1987/88 financial year, analysts said.\n    Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted\nthat any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would\ndepend on the reaction of the markets.\n    The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59\npct from 20 pct currently, he said.\n    However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not\nrepeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard\nreturning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from\nits cash flow -- were good.\n    Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.\n    Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to\nmake money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from\nproduction and its downstream activities would push it\ncomfortably into surplus.\n    BP initially took a stake in Standard following the\ndiscovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had\ninadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,\nwhich was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude\noil.\n    The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management\nreorganisation of Standard in the past year.\n    The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was\nnow complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the\ntender offer, Spedding said.\n    BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major\nbalance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well\nreceived in the markets.\n    The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially\nafter the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division\n-- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come\nstraight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by\nother sectors.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"26-MAR-1987 03:46:10.54","topics":["acq"],"places":["uk"]},"9734":{"title":"HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES","body":"Hoechst AG <HFAG.F> said in a\nstatement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a\nfall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.\n    The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and\nother currencies against the mark.

The APT was set up in January.\n    SyCip said about 75 pct of the 400-odd assets that the DBP\nand the PNB are handing over to the APT are still in the form\nof financial assets.\n    \"In some cases financial assets have been converted into\nphysical assets by foreclosures. They are fairly cut and dried\nbecause we are dealing with mostly whole production facilities\nlike textile or food-processing plants,\" he said.\n    \"Financial assets are more complicated. The only recourse is\nto foreclose, gain titles, and try to sell the asset, but the\nlaws here tend to favour the debtors,\" he added.\n    SyCip said although the APT is protected from prosecution\nby its charter, many debtors are tying up the panel with\nlitigation.\n    \"If you see some of the situations we have to work our way\nthrough you will see that our symbol, a Gordian knot, is an apt\nillustration,\" he said.\n    SyCip said the PNB has not succeeded in foreclosing on 16\nof the 17 sugar factories it wants to sell because of the high\ncosts involved. \"When you do your arithmetic you realise that if\nyou did foreclose your recovery would be only a fraction of the\nasset's book exposure,\" he said.\n    SyCip said the APT was not worried about whether associates\nof former President Ferdinand Marcos, who originally owned many\nof the bankrupt companies, would buy them back through the\nprivatisation scheme.\n    \"We just look at the bottom line, which is to monetise these\nassets to the maximum degree possible,\" he said. \"We are selling\nfor cash, it is not our concern where it comes from.\"\n    He said he had told cabinet ministers sceptical about the\nidentities of buyers that \"Marcos cronies\" could easily put up\nlegitimate fronts if they were specifically barred from bidding\nfor assets on the block.\n    \"I told them if I am paid 20 mln pesos in 100-peso bills,\nall with identical serial numbers and they look like genuine\nlegal currency, then I would accept them',\" SyCip said.\n    He said some participants in the government's debt-equity\nswap scheme were interested in buying non-performing assets\nwith the pesos they receive from such deals. The problem is\ngovernment regulations slow down approval of debt-equity plans\nand the APT normally demands full payment within 15 days.\n    \"The Central Bank and Monetary Board could also look at\ninvestment funds earmarked for non-performing asset purchases,\"\nhe said. \"It would greatly facilitate matters.\"\n    SyCip said last month the APT hoped to recover about 24\nbillion pesos of the assets' total worth of 108 billion.\n    President Corazon Aquino announced earlier this month that\nproceeds from the sale of APT-controlled assets would be used\nto finance the government's land reform program, which aims to\ndistribute about 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants.\n    Asked why the APT did not favour Filipino buyers, SyCip\nsaid: \"How much money has the country to lose because of this\n'Filipinos first' slogan? How many people have become\nmillionaires and then forgotten the Philippines and put their\nmoney in the United States or Australia?\"\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"26-MAR-1987 05:39:20.94","places":["philippines"]},"9759":{"title":"SINGAPORE LAWS TO LIBERALISE LOCAL CAPITAL MARKET","body":"Parliament passed laws increasing the\namounts and frequency of treasury bill issues and allowing the\ngovernment to raise up to 35 billion dlrs through issues of\nregistered stock, bearer bonds and book-entry securities.\n    Both steps are aimed at establishing a wider domestic\ncapital market as part of Singapore's plans to expand its\nfinancial sector, Finance Minister Richard Hu said.\n    Banking sources said the new government securities market,\nscheduled to have been launched on March 2, had been delayed\npending legislative approval of these bills.\n    The 35 billion dlrs maximum which may be raised under the\nDevelopment Loan Bill (1987), against a ceiling of 15 billion\nunder current laws, is expected to satisfy demand for\ngovernment securities over the next four years, Hu said.\n    He said 6.1 billion dlrs of the 15 billion has so far been\nraised as development loans.

At some time during that period all the\nproducers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.\n    These changes did not always result in lower export\nsubsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more\nthan offset lower prices in the domestic currency.\n    For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention\nprice for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European\ncurrency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which\nmost export transactions are denominated, the intervention\nprice however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of\nsupporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers\nand some governments are now searching for ways to cut\nexpenditure, the report says.\n    The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five\nmajor exporters declined in the period covered by the survey\nfrom 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to\nincreased production in China and India.\n    The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was\ncountered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower\nacreages.\n    In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per\ncent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to\nother enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.\nAcreages are attributed to official incentives.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"26-MAR-1987 08:04:20.61","topics":["grain","wheat"],"organisations":["iwc-wheat","ec"],"places":["uk","usa","argentina","australia","canada"]},"9794":{"title":"SANDOZ HAS 50 MLN DLR EURO-CP PROGRAM","body":"Sandoz Corp, a U.S. Subsidiary of Sandoz\nAG, is establishing a 50 mln dlr euro-commercial paper (CP)\nprogram, Morgan Guaranty Ltd said as one of the dealers.\n    The other dealer is Swiss Bank Corp International Ltd and\nMorgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York is issuing and paying\nagent.\n    Paper will have maturities between seven and 183 days and\nwill be issued in global and definitive form.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"26-MAR-1987 08:08:13.06","places":["uk"]},"9795":{"title":"U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER OPPOSES TAX INCREASE","body":"U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\nsaid that he opposes a Federal tax increase to help reduce the\nbudget deficit and favors spending cuts instead.\n    \"I don't think it's (a tax increase) is a very good idea\nand I'm quite confident that President Reagan doesn't think\nit's a very good idea,\" Baker said in an interview on Cable\nNews Network's \"Moneyline\" television program.\n    He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP\nwhich is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal\nGovernment is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP.

That was the date\nof the first Mexican debt crisis.\n    After months of haggling, a proposed rescheduling agreement\nfor Mexico was struck last September during the annual meeting\nof the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in\nWashington.\n    Ever since then the advisory group, of which Lloyds is a\nmember, has been attempting to round up the needed signatories.\n    However, there has been considerable resistance to the\npackage, partly because of some of the clauses it contains and\npartly because many small U.S. Regional banks do not want to\nincrease their exposure to any Latin American countries.\n    Brougham said, \"We (British banks) have always played along\nfor Mexico and will do so as long as others share equally.\"\n    The decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the six\nclearers jointly, but each sent its own telex.\n    In addition to Lloyds, telexes were sent by National\nWestminster Bank Plc, Barclays Bank Plc, Midland Bank Plc,\ntandard Chartered Bank Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.\n    Brougham noted that so far the U.S. Banks have only reached\n83-1/2 pct of the total that is expected from them, while the\nlevel of contributions from the U.K. Banks is well in excess of\n90 pct. \"The U.S. Figure should be closer to ours,\" he said.\n    Many bankers have been angered by the resistance of the\nregional U.S. Banks, noting that even if they don't contribute\nto the new loan they still will be receiving interest on the\nexisting loans.\n    The banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement and\nbankers are hoping all will go according to plan.\n    In the meantime, bankers expect further pressure will be\nexercised on the regional banks and the major U.S. Banks to\nfind a solution to the problem. Many have suggested that the\nlarger U.S. Banks should take on the additional obligations,\nbut so far they have resisted this.\n    Bankers expect that much of the pressure on the U.S. Banks\nwill come from U.S. Regulators, notably the Federal Reserve.\n    Bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the British\nbanks and other national groups as \"a matter of principal, and\nburden sharing\" rather than as a \"pressure tactic\" to force the\nU.S. Banks to make up their share.\n    The bankers are not the only ones to be upset by the\nprotracted negotiations surrounding the agreement.\n    The Mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays. At\nthe signing in New York last Friday, Finance Minister Gustavo\nPetricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks.\n    \"Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico will\ncontinue to be open and willing to share with them the business\nopportunities which its future growth will create,\" Petricioli\nsaid.\n    Conversion of bank debt into equity investments in Mexico\nis one option banks can take advantage of to reduce their\nexposure. But Mexico halted its debt for equity program in\nFebruary in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package.\n    On Friday, Petricioli said \"We will be a lot more\nexpeditious in processing the requests of banks that have\nsupported us.\"\n    The pressure on the U.S. Banks comes at a time when other\nmajor Latin American debtors are in the process of crucial debt\nnegotiations.\n    Brazil, the third world's largest debtor, has suspended all\ninterest payments on its 109 billion dlrs of foreign debt. Many\nof the major U.S. Banks, including Citibank, have already said\nthey might have to put their Brazil loans on a cash basis and\ntake the financial losses, which could total billions of\ndollars.\n    This would be required by U.S. Banking regulations if the\ninterest payments are more than 90 days overdue.\n    However, the U.S. Banks are not the only ones threatened by\nregulations.

Money market sources said the market had begun\nto doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates\nto 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.\n    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.\n    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the\nExchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account\ndeficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.\n    Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in\nFebruary to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.\n    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.\n    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and\nDrew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would\nprove partly aberrational in coming months.

They noted Lawson had\nalready got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in\nresponse to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for\nlower rates have been curtailed.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"26-MAR-1987 09:24:31.15","topics":["trade","bop","interest","stg","money-fx"],"places":["uk"]},"9849":{"title":"S.

But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it\nwants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.\"\n    In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground\nfor triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments\nof growth and inflation, economists said.\n    Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the\nBundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,\nraising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the\nmedium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.\n    As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move\nthat would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said.\n    In the current round, the country's most powerful union,\nthe IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is\ndemanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the\npresent 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.\n    The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, is\noffering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give\na two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this\nyear and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.\n    The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largest\nunion, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the\nbenchmark for settlements in other industries such as the\npublic sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations\nbegan in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by\nearly April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June.\n    Though many economists said the unions' current warning\nstrikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and\nwould not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week\nstrikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on\ntheir positions and there could still be conflict.\n    This could extend the length of time in which the\nBundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said.\n    The money market head said the unions' humiliation by the\nprotracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative\nhousing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.\n    \"The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this\nsquarely onto the account in the negotiations,\" he said.\n    In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall\nunion, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than\nhis predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle\nto achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.\n    More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in\nsouth Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours\nyesterday.

attempt to buy BankAmerica\nCorp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy,\nbut he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.\n    In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking for\nways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,\n\"so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our\nindependence, if possible.\"\n    In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major\nEast Coast banks to buy banks in California.\n    First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and\nthe nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western\nstates and has franchise operations in four additional states.\n    Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for\nlarge U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the \nlucrative California market and the West Coast region.\n    While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when\nasked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,\n\"That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive\nnot to think that.\"\n    Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as\n\"opportunistic\".\n    He said he will look for banks in management trouble that\nhe can get at a bargain, then add management to restore\nprofitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate\nalready operates, then cut costs by combining resources.\n    The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most\nof the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased\nat a discount because of the depressed regional economy.\n    Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move\nhim to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, \"We\ncontinue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of\npeople continue to monitor and look at us.\"\n    Banking analysts, however, consider another First\nInterstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen\nany time soon.\n    Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25\nbillion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, \"a very,\nvery difficult decision.\"\n    With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First\nInterstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number\nfour position in the California banking community.\n    \"The competition in this state is tough,\" he said, noting\nCityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches\nfrom Sears Roebuck company. \"CityBank is moving rapidly to move\nus down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth,\" he said.\n    Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security\nPacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona,\nWashington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional\ncompetitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.\n    \"Security is, has been and continues to be a highly\nprofitable and obviously well managed company,\" he said.\n    He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the\nadvantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer\nand has the recognition advantage of having given its regional\nbanks a common name.\n    Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good\nfinancial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain\nserious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,\nreal estate and agriculture dominate the economy.\n    Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,\nhe said, \"I don't think it has bottomed out, because I think\nmost of the problems are real estate-related and the real\nestate problems are going to be with us for several years.\"\n    Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in\nthe Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate's\nfranchise operation.\n    First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First\nInterstate financial services in ten states.\n    While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise\noperation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because\nmost of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into\nthe Midwest must come first.\n    Calling the franchise system, \"moderately profitable,\"\nPinola said, \"It is going to take a rejuvenation of the\nagriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed\nwe were generating before the last year or two.\"\n    On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks\n1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks\nwith minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"26-MAR-1987
