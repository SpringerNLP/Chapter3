U.S. Lenders,\nmostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low\nas three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their\nportfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to\ninduce them to retain their accounts.\n    As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were\nforced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose\nrates would move in line with the cost of funds.\n    \"We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,\"\nsaid a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,\nexplaining why his institution, for the time being, is only\noffering variable rate mortgages.\n    The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped\nhomebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders\nconcede they are being forced to undercut each other still\nmore.\n    Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier\nthis week by the nation's two largest building societies and by\nNational Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for\nnew business, officials at all three institutions said.\n    The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even\nbelow those on the variable rate loans.\n    \"Of course they are less profitable than other (variable\nrate) mortgages,\" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which\nearlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate\nnew mortgage loans.\n    But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable\nloans because, \"It was just another way to attract people to our\nmortgage product.\"\n    Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed\nrate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.\n    The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was\nexhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.\n    \"Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,\" she said, noting\nthat within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct\nof its 1986 volume.\n    In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they\noffer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest\nrates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the\nlender is earning an above average return on assets.\n    But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won\nthe benefit of cheap money.\n    Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed\nrate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption\nthat a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates\nfall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.\n    Young explained that the company had planned to protect\nitself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a\ncomplicated hedging instrument.\n    But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations\nand the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He\nsaid money market rates were too high to arrange both the\nmortgages and hedge profitably.\n    However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does\nmake fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them.

They were not cost efficient,\" LaTronica said. \"Now\nDOD has allowed the situation to swing so far back the other\nway that you may be in danger of losing the defense industry as\na national resource.\"\n    While the nation as a whole has posted trade deficits in\nrecent years, aerospace and defense has exported more products\nthan it imported, he noted.\n    LaTronica and others said, however, that changes in\ngovernment procurement may be coming.\n    \"I hear that the Pentagon is looking into the situation,\"\nsaid John Diamantis, defense analyst at Pershing and Co.\n    He said that some small defense electronics firms believe\nthe Pentagon will begin re-evaluating procurement policy and\nperhaps start paying more development money.\n    Redding Research's LaTronica, who still likes the industry\ndespite the probability of additional unforeseen writeoffs,\nsaid, \"There's been a swing in sentiment. The defense bashing\npsychology of the last few years is starting to shift.\"\n    LaTronica noted that one government official has recently\nsuggested that the winner of the ATF prototype award should get\nsole production of the plane for a specified time.\n    The investments are large. The Lockheed, General Dynamics,\nBoeing ATF team, for example, is spending 691 mln dlrs just to\ndevelop the prototype.\n    The danger the Pentagon runs if changes are not made is\nthat companies will hesitate to bid to develop a program but\ninstead will wait for a second source production award.\n    \"But it may take a company going bust to really change\npeople's thinking,\" LaTronica said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-JUN-1987 13:20:06.33","places":["usa"]},"19290":{"title":"REED SAYS IT HAS NO COMMENT ON HARCOURT RUMOURS","body":"Reed International Plc <REED.L> said it\nhad no comment to make on U.K. stock market rumors that\nHarcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc <HBJ> may make a bid for the\ncompany in order to escape unwelcome offers from Robert\nMaxwell's British Printing and Communication Corp <BPCL.L>.\n    A spokeswoman for Reed said earlier analysts forecasts that\na bid for Reed will have to be about 700 mln stg were totally\nunrealistic, adding that its current market is about 2.7\nbillion stg.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-JUN-1987 13:22:59.41","topics":["acq"],"places":["uk"]},"19291":{"title":"UNOCAL<UCL> SCRAPS FLUIDIZED BED BOILER PROJECT","body":"Unocal Corp said it told the U.S.\nTreasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed\ncombustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning\nof solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Colorado\ndue to high costs.\n    Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic\nFuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at\nthe oil shale plant.

The study advocated reduction of\ncholesterol in some 40 mln Americans.\n    As the anti-cholesterol crusade gains momentum, industry\nanalysts and executives believe a healthier diet and drug\ntherapy will gain wider acceptance.\n    In this context, pharmaceutical analyst David Crossen of\nSanford C. Bernstein said \"the culture can shift in terms of\ndrug treatment because some people arn't going to fundamentally\nalter their diets\".\n    The worldwide anti-cholesterol drug market is valued at 600\nmln dlrs a year. But as the new drugs reach the market,\nanalysts estimate revenues will swell to 1.5 billion dlrs\nannually in about next five years.\n    The drugs used in the study, in combination with the low\ncholesterol diet, were niacin, a common compound, and\ncolestipol, a drug Upjohn Co <UPJ> has sold since 1977.\n    But these two drugs have some drawbacks that analysts say\nthe new drugs from Merck and Squibb avoid. \"Niacin leads to\ntremendous amounts of flushing, constipation, or stomach\nupset,\" Crossen said.\n    Colestipol, a sand-like powder, comes in a dosage of 15 to\n30 grams and must be mixed with a glass of water. \"It isn't fun\nto take,\" Crossen said. Drug analyst Uhl said the drawbacks\nrestricted Upjohn's sales for the drug, which he said is under\n10 mln dlrs a year.\n    In contrast, the new drugs from Merck and Squibb have\nlittle side effects because they target a key factor in the\nbody's production of cholesterol -- an enzyme found in the\nliver.\n   \n    \"Past methods of getting down cholesterol have been rather\nvariable,\" said Dr. Charles Sanders, an executive vice\npresident at Squibb. The new drugs, in contrast, interupt a\nclear step in cholesterol production, Sanders said.\n    Also, the new drugs are easier to take since they come in a\ntablet form swallowed once or twice a day.\n    Merck's drug, Mevacor, received a recommendation from an\nadvisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration earlier this\nyear and is expected to receive full approval for sale in late\nsummer or fall.\n    Squibb's drug, eptastatin, is expected to be submitted for\nregulatory approval in the first or second quarter 1988,\nSanders said.\n    Warner Lambert Co <WLA> and Bristol Meyers Co <BMY> also\nhave cholesterol fighting compounds similar to the Upjohn drug,\nbut only Merck and Upjohn are ahead in the new class of\ncholesterol inhibitors.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-JUN-1987 13:26:10.54","places":["usa"]},"19293":{"title":"CIVIL SERVICE STRIKE DELAYS U.K. TRADE FIGURES","body":"Civil service industrial action started\nearly this month will delay the publication of May's U.K.\nOverseas trade figures, which had been due out next Thursday, a\nTrade and Industry Department statement said.\n    A department spokesman said the figures will probably be\nput back by about a month.

In a prepared\nstatement, Lloyds Bank chief executive Brian Pitman said the\nbank had a \"relatively small position in these two overcrowded\nmarkets and we have decided to reallocate the resources to\nopportunities which promise a better return on our shareholders\ninvestment.\"\n    Lloyds said it would maintain its presence in short-term\nsecurities trading, swaps and other treasury products.\n    Alan Moore, Lloyds Treasurer, told Reuters that the\ndecision was forward looking and followed a \"strategic review\" of\nthe prospects for Lloyds in these markets. \"We decided the\nreturn just was not attractive,\" he said.\n    Although the decision was made at a meeting of Lloyds board\nthis morning, Moore said that it had been under consideration\nfor some time.\n    He denied that the move was a \"reaction to events in the\ntrading room\" although he acknowledged that the bank's gilt\noperations were not profitable in the early stages of the new\nmarket.\n    Greenwell's Brown noted that for all of 1986, Lloyds\nMerchant Bank sustained a loss of 28 mln stg, most of which he\nsaid were accounted for by the Eurobond and gilt operations.\nFor all of 1986, Lloyds reported a pre-tax profit of 700 mln\nstg. \"Lloyds is so big, it can easily absorb these losses,\" Brown\nsaid, noting that they are minuscule when compared with the\nbank's exposure to Latin America.\n    U.K. Clearing banks have come under pressure to increase\ntheir provisions against bad loans to third world countries\nsince Citibank announced plans to add three billion dlrs to its\nprovisions in mid-May.\n    National Westminster Bank Plc <NWBL.L>, the largest of the\nclearers, became the first of the U.K. Clearers to follow\nCiticorp's <CCI> move earlier this week when it said it was\nadding some 466 mln stg to its sovereign debt provisions.\n    Lloyds has the second largest exposure to Latin America\nafter Midland Bank, the smallest of the four clearers.\n    Lloyds has said it is reviewing the situation and Moore\ndenied that today's action had any connection. \"It is totally\nunrelated,\" he said.\n    Trading in Eurobonds and gilts had ended by the time the\nannouncement was made. But market participants were\ndumbfounded.\n    \"We only heard the news about 20 minutes before the\nannouncement. I had no idea it was coming. I don't know if I\nstill have job,\" said one trader at Lloyds who declined to be\nidentified. Lloyds' Moore said that the bank would do all it\ncould to redeploy the staff affected by the decision in other\nparts of the bank. But even though Lloyds' share of these\nmarkets was relatively small, other market participants,\nparticularly in gilts, were unnerved.\n    One senior gilt market maker noted that the news comes\nduring a period when both gilt and Eurosterling markets have\nbeen battered by the lack of investor participation, following\nthe June 11 U.K. general election.\n    Most firms had held long positions on expectations that a\nreturn of the ruling Conservative party would prompt heavy\ndemand. These expectations have failed to be met and both\nmarkets have sustained sizeable losses since the election.\n    Lloyds has long been the subject of rumors that it was\nexperiencing problems with its gilt operations and officials\nhave never denied that the early stages were unprofitable.\n    Gilt market sources suggested that one of the problems\nfacing Lloyds on the gilt side was its decision to build up its\nown team. It was the only clearer which did not purchase a\nbroker or a jobber (middle man) in the run-up to Big Bang.\n    Under the old system, these functions have been conducted\nseparately but now market makers perform both tasks.\n    But even long before Big Bang, market makers had expressed\ndoubts that the gilt market would be large enough to sustain 27\nmarket makers, even if turnover increased substantially.\n    And with Lloyds withdrawal, many market makers believe that\nsome of the remaining 26 may opt to bow out gracefully.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-JUN-1987 14:34:02.92","places":["uk"]},"19354":{"title":"REED'S CHAIRMAN DENIES BID RUMORS\n","date":"19-JUN-1987 14:39:40.14"},"19355":{"title":"SEC SUPPORTS INSIDER TRADING DEFINITION","body":"The Securities and Exchange\nCommission said it supported legislation to define insider\ntrading and would recommend language for such a definition\nwithin six weeks.\n    Acting SEC chairman Charles Cox told the Senate Banking\nCommittee a bill proposed this week to define insider trading\nas the wrongful use of material nonpublic information was good\nbut contained some ambiguous provisions which might reduce the\nCommission's flexibility in prosecuting cases.\n    \"The Commission believes a definition of insider trading is\ndesirable,\" Cox said.\n   \n    He promised to provide the SEC's recommended definition to\nthe committee by August 3.\n    The bill proposed by Sens.

Ford has been \"a little bit of a\nlaggard\" in that area, he said, which has been a concern to\nsome investors.\n    Chrysler's first big move away from autos came in 1985,\nwhen it purchased Gulfstream for 637 mln dlrs.\n    Defense analysts said Chrysler was paying a high price for\nElectrospace but auto analysts regarded it as a modest outlay\nfor the company. Electrospace earned 10 mln dlrs on sales of\n191 mln dlrs in fiscal 1987 ended April 3.\n    Kirnan said Chrysler may have some trouble digesting the\nRichardson, Texas, electronics firm because it is also buying\nAmerican Motors Corp <AMC> for about two billion dlrs in a deal\nset to close later this year.\n    \"Chrysler will have their hands full absorbing AMC for a\nyear or more and will absorb a lot of debt,\" Kirnan said,\nmaking them the most heavily leveraged auto company.\n    But other analysts said the relative small size of\nElectrospace will make it easy for Chrysler to absorb.\n    Analysts also noted that Hughes has contributed\nsignificantly to GM and that Gulfstream provided about 57 mln\ndlrs in pretax earnings to Chrysler last year.\n    In a statement, Chrysler said 92 pct of Electrospace's\nsales were to the military.\n    In addition to helping Gulfstream gain government business,\nChrysler said it believes electronics technology will help the\nautomobile business.\n    Robert Miller Jr, Chrysler Corp vice chairman, said that\nGulfstream's business, for example, involves electronics,\ncomposites and aerodynamic design. \"Those will all be important\ntechnologies for winning in the automobile business in the\n1990s,\" Miller told Reuters. Electrospace should add\nsignificantly to the electronics area, he said.\n    Miller said Electrospace earnings last year were hurt by\none-time items and but should recover this year.\n    Miller said cash on hand will be used to pay for\nElectrospace.\n    \"They have a substantial presence in Washington with 150 or\nmore professional people. They also have accounting systems in\nTexas to manage their business with the Defense Department,\" he\nsaid.\n    Both should be important in moving Gulfstream into the\nmilitary market. \"Gulfstream traditionally has been aimed more\nat the commercial market, which is a different kettle of fish,\"\nMiller said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-JUN-1987 16:14:16.79","places":["usa"]},"19416":{"title":"U.S. BUSINESS LOANS FALL 896 MLN DLRS IN JUNE 10 WEEK,\nFED SAYS\n\n","date":"19-JUN-1987 16:15:12.20","topics":["money-supply"],"places":["usa"]},"19417":{"title":"NYSE SAYS SHORT INTEREST UP 28.9 MLN SHARES FOR MONTH\nENDED JUNE 15\n","date":"19-JUN-1987 16:15:23.24"},"19418":{"title":"U.S. BUSINESS LOANS FELL 896 MLN DLRS","body":"Business loans on the books of major\nU.S. banks, excluding acceptances, fell 896 mln dlrs to 275.61\nbillion in the week ended June 10, the Federal Reserve Board\nsaid.\n    The Fed said that business loans including acceptances fell\n546 mln dlrs to 278.12 billion dlrs.\n\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-JUN-1987 16:16:39.43","topics":["money-fx"],"places":["usa"]},"19419":{"title":"JUDGE TO RULE MONDAY ON BURLINGTON <BUR> CASE","body":"Manhattan Federal Court Judge Shirley\nWohl Kram said she would rule Monday on whether to grant a\nrequest to block a 78 dlr per share merger agreement between\nBurlington Industries Inc and Morgan Stanely Group Inc <MS>.\n    The request to bar the merger was made by Samjens\nAcquisition Corp, a partnership formed by financier Asher B.\nEdelman and Dominion Textiles Inc.

The price gyrations have\ncombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented\nvolatility to some U.S. securities markets.\n    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some\nlawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate\ntakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers\nsteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.\n    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign\nexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork\nfor an international securities marketplace in which trading\noccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.\n    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment\nopportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce\nU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.\n    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial\ndisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,\neliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to\nspur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's\nreview of hostile corporate takeovers.\n    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton\ninvestment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to\nthe agency upon being named chairman in 1981.\n    In line with the views of other top administration\nofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover\nbattles over new federal regulations.\n    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider\ntrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that\ntopped the agency's enforcement agenda during the\nadministration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.\n    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with\nRuder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to\nsignificantly alter the commission's current priorities.\n    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them\nlawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that\nfigure likely will be significantly higher next year as the\nagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.\n    The agency is one of the few in the government that\nactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past\nfew years because of fees it charges public companies,\ninvestment banks and other securities firms it regulates.\n    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,\nmeaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the\npresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing\nfor policy differences alone.\n    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same\npolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget request\neach year instead of leaving this to the White House.\n    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins\nto the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed\nin large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted\nmarket manipulations by large investment firms.\n    The agency requires public companies and investment\nvehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on\ntheir financial condition and to disclose changes in their\ncondition any time they issue new securities.\n    It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to\nregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, and\nit polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.\n    Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial\nmagnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to\nbecome the nation's 35th president.\n    Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served\nfrom 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in\n1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's\nfirst term and was Reagan's director of the Central\nIntelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-JUN-1987 16:37:13.51","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"19433":{"title":"U.S. ASKS CONGRESS TO REVISE TARIFF CATEGORIES","body":"The Administration asked Congress to\nreplace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it\ninto line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade\nRepresentative Clayton Yeutter said.\n    The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more\naccurately define new composites, items not widely traded when\nthe current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.\n    Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is\ncalled, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet\nthe present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they\nshould pay about the same rates of duties.\n    Yeutter said, \"American exporters will find it far easier to\ndeal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of\ndiffering systems which they now face.\"\n    He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational\nnegotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.\n    Yeutter said government and business moves are based on\ndata from tariff schedules and the new system will improve\nknowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.\n    He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under\nthe new system, with about half expected to join the system by\nJanuary 1988.\n reuter\n\u0003","date":"19-JUN-1987 16:42:17.98","topics":["trade"],"places":["usa"]},"19434":{"title":"MOODY'S AFFIRMS PNC FINANCIAL <PNCF>, UNITS DEBT","body":"Moody's Investors Service Inc said it\naffirmed 500 mln dlrs of debt of PNC Financial and units.\n    Affirmed were Aa-2 senior debt of PNC Financial Corp and\nPNC Funding Corp, AAA long-term deposits of Pittsburgh National\nBank, and Aa-2 long-term deposits of Citizens Fidelity Bank and\nTrust.\n    Moody's cited PNC's announced special second-quarter loan\nloss provision of 110 mln dlrs to raise loss reserve coverage\nof loans to economically troubled borrowers in less-developed\ncountries.

The new\ncomputers, the most powerful of which will use Intel Corp's\nfast 80386 microprocessor, are expected to rejuvenate the\nsagging sales of the personal computer industry and already\ngave a big boost to IBM.\n    Company officials said last week that 250,000 PS/2s were\nshipped in the 2-1/2 months since their introduction and IBM\nexpect record pc sales ths year as a result.\n    The enthusiasm for the PS-2 is particularly striking since\nthe full potential of the powerful computers cannot be tapped\nuntil a new operating system or other high level software is\navailable, analysts said.\n    OS-2 will allow users to work on many different programs,\nor tasks, at once on a personal computer, ideally without any\nslowdown in operation, a capability the industry has long\nstrived for.\n    Microsoft is already promising alternatives to OS-2, in\nparticular an advanced version of its Windows multitasking\nprogram, which is used in conjunction with MS-DOS.\n    Microsoft chairman Bill Gates has suggested an advanced\nversion of the program, Windows 386, will be announced in\nSeptember and available six to eight weeks later, at a price of\n100 dlrs and 300 dlrs. OS/2 is expected to cost 325 dlrs.\n\n    Some software developers have said the the program,\ndesigned for 80386-based personal computers, may even be\nsuperior to OS/2 in allowing users to multitask applications\nwithout disruption.\n     But several analysts commented that what users really want\nis a multi-taksing operating system for 80386-based personal\ncomputers, and so far that desire has been met primarily by a\nsmall Atlanta software publisher, The Software Link Inc. In\nlate spring the company announced PC-MOS/386, a multi-tasking,\nmultiuser operating system that is compatible with MS/DOS and\nworks on 80386-based computers.\n    The company said it filled 2,500 orders in the first four\nweeks of availability and expects shipments to reach 40,000 by\nyear end.\n    International Data Corp analyst Will Zachmann said Unix\ncould be the most promising alternative to OS/2, even once the\nIVM system is available.\n    IBM did not endorse Unix for any of its PS/2 models,\nalthough it did say that it would announce a version of its\nAdvanced Interactive Executive (AIX), a Unix compatible\noperating system.\n    But the federal government requires Unix compatability for\nmost of its computer contracts, it is almost certain that other\ncompanies will provide Unix-style operating systems for the IBM\nsystems.\n    ATT itself two weeks ago introduced a version of Unix that\nis compatible with the 80386 microprocessor, although not IBM's\ncomputer specifically.\n    Analysts saw the announcement as a move to get Unix\naccepted as a strong alternative to OS/2 before the IBM system\nhas a chance to take off.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"29-JUN-1987 09:06:40.00"},"19590":{"title":"KUWAIT SETS HIGHER 1987/88 BUDGET DEFICIT","body":"Kuwait, aided by the recovery in world\noil prices, announced a mildly expansionary budget for 1987/88\nwith a 3.3 pct rise in the deficit to 1.38 billion dinars.\n    Oil revenues, slashed by some 40 pct in the original budget\nfor the 1986/87 year ending tomorrow, were forecast to rise 4.2\npct to 1.73 billion dinars in 1987/88, Finance Minister Jassim\nal-Khorafi said.\n    This would account for 87.2 pct of total estimated income\nin the year starting on July 1 compared with 86.6 pct in\noriginal 1986/87 estimates, the Kuwait News Agency Kuna quoted\nhim as saying.\n    Spending by ministries and public institutions is forecast\nto be 3.4 pct higher at 3.16 billion dinars in 1987/88 after an\n11 pct cut in the current fiscal year's budget.\n    In addition the government, as is usual, will transfer a\nsum equal to 10 pct of total expected revenue to a special\nsavings reserve for future generations.\n    The minister made no mention of how the deficit would be\ncovered.

He saw a slightly\nhigher current account surplus than Ifo of possibly 65 billion\nmarks.\n    Helmut Henschel, with Westdeutsche Landesbank, put the 1987\ntrade surplus at 95 billion marks and the current account\nsurplus at 60 billion marks.\n    He said the strong rise in exports in May from the year-ago\nperiod was surprising but it probably reflected calendar\nfactors.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"29-JUN-1987 10:00:18.60"},"19618":{"title":"SEC SEEKS COURT REVIEW OF TEXACO <TX> CASE","body":"Texaco Inc said the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission will urge the Texas Supreme\nCourt to accept the Texaco, Pennzoil Co <PZL> case for review\nwith respect to Commission Rule 10b-13 as it applies to the\nfacts of the case.\n    Texaco said it is pleased and encouraged by the SEC's\ndecision, pointing out \"Pennzoil's own counsel told the trial\ncourt that 'If Rule 10B-13 was an impediment, then in fact our\ncontract was void' and further that, if the alleged contract\nwas void, \"we have no case.'\"\n    In a letter dated June 26, the SEC's general counsel told\nattorneys representing Texaco and Pennzoil the commission will\nurge the Texas Supreme Court to review the issue of federal\nsecurities law in the Texaco-Pennzoil case, Texaco said.\n    \"This is to inform you that the commission has determined\nto file a brief amicus curiae in the (Texaco-Pennzoil)\nlitigation.

increase its warships in\nand around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on\nunprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a\ndirect military clash with Iran, diplomats said.\n    They said the American decision inevitably carries some\nrisk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt\nrhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.\n    \"As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the\nGulf could do serious damage,\" said one western diplomat.\n    Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks\non \"soft targets\" such as

However, \"There is the threat that the\nIranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,\nwill go for softer targets,\" one diplomat said.\n    Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar\nHashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was\n\"moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.\"\n    The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10\nwarships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to\npatrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.\n    The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting\nKuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered\nto fly the American flag to give them naval protection.\n    Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by\nIran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.\n    Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by\nChinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is\npreparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.\n    The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to\nmake Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.\n    A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a\nlaunching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the\nFaw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.\n    \"But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti\nterritory would be a very serious escalation\" likely moving\nworld opinion against Iran, remarked one.\n    Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying\nout reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.\n    Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted\nlast Friday \"a river of blood\" throughout the world in the event\nof any U.S. strike against Iran.\n    Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused\nof being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable\ncapacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.\n    Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that\nmost Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to\npro-Iranian groups.

Land\nrights activists see no progress at all and say things are\nactually worsening. Over the last year economic pressures have\nforced many small producers to sell out to big land-owners.\n    Land reform, one of the country's most hotly-debated\npolitical issues, is particularly to the fore this year as a\nConstituent Assembly in Brasilia draws up a new constitution.\n    Land rights campaigners say that if the new charter does\nnot give fresh hope for the country's 4.5 mln landless\nfamilies, there will be wave upon wave of land occupations.\n    \"We make no secret of our tactics,\" said one leader of the\nland reform movement, Joao Pedro. \"The solution is to occupy --\nthat is what we say to the rural workers. There has not been a\nsingle program of land reform in the world without the people\noccupying land.\"\n    The land issue spawns violence from Amazonia to Mato\nGrosso. Some 278 people died in land disputes last year,\naccording to the Pastoral Commission for Land, which is linked\nto the Roman Catholic Church.\n    The land reform program, announced in 1985 soon after the\ncivilian government of President Jose Sarney took power, aimed\nto resettle 1,4 mln families by 1989 by gradually splitting up\nthe country's vast, undeveloped estates.\n    The government, in its National Plan for Agrarian Reform,\ndescribed the program as \"one of its absolute priorities.\"\n    In practice, fewer than 20,000 families have been helped so\nfar and the government admits that it will not get anywhere\nnear the original target.\n    Political analysts said that the pace of land reform was\nnow slower under Sarney than it had been under the military\ngovernment of General Joao Figueiredo (1979-85).\n    The slow progress on the issue is fuelling deep\nfrustration. Land rights demonstrations are a common sight in\nSao Paulo and other parts of the country.\n    Activists say social conditions in the countryside, far\nfrom improving, have significantly deteriorated.\n    Pedro, a leader of the Movement of Landless Rural Workers,\nsaid that over the last 12 months 100,000 small producers had\nbeen forced off the land in Brazil's five southernmost states.\n    He said the exodus had been caused first by the\ngovernment's anti-inflation Cruzado Plan, which last year froze\nprices and hit the income of small farmers.\n    When the Cruzado Plan collapsed late last year, prices and\ninterest rates soared and many small farmers were unable to pay\ndebts taken out during the price freeze.\n    Pedro said most of the 100,000 families who had left the\ncountryside in the south had previously been land-owners, while\na minority had been tenant farmers. Most had moved to Brazil's\nswollen cities.\n    One activist said the number of landless day labourers\ncalled \"boias-frias\" (literally \"cold meals\"), most of whom cut\nsugar cane, had increased to 400,000 in Sao Paulo state from\nabout 300,000 five years ago.\n    In an attempt to improve the lot of the rural poor, the\nland reform movement has drawn up a radical proposal which it\nis sending to the Constituent Assembly.\n    The proposal would severely limit the size of a maximum\npermissible holding and the land rights movement does not\nexpect it to be voted into the constitution.\n    Pedro said at least 70 pct of the 559-member assembly is\ncomposed of big land-owners. He added that the assembly would\nprobably vote on the proposal by October and that its rejection\nwould be the signal for large-scale land invasions.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"29-JUN-1987 15:51:10.06","places":["brazil"]},"19878":{"title":"S/P UPGRADES PHELPS DODGE <PD> DEBT, PREFERRED","body":"Standard and Poor's Corp said it\nupgraded Phelps Dodge Corp's senior debt to BB-plus from BB and\npreference stock to BB-minus from B-plus.\n    About 400 mln dlrs of debt and preference stock is\noutstanding.\n    Continuing cost cutting in its copper operations has\nsignificantly enhanced the firm's competitive position, S and P\nsaid.

Some analysts construed this as positive for Texaco since\nthey said it is alleged by Texaco that Pennzoil violated the\nrule, and the issue was not thoroughly addressed in lower Texas\ncourts.\n    Texaco's stock rose 1-1/2 to 39-3/8 and Pennzoil fell four\nto 78-7/8. A Pennzoil attorney would not comment. He said the\nSEC rule, 10b-13, is part of Texaco's argument in its request\nfor a Texas Supreme Court case, and that the matter has been\npreviously addressed in court. Pennzoil said it knew of the SEC\nbrief but it did not know whether the brief would support the\nview of one litigant or be an inquiry and request for\nclarification of the reasons for two lower state court\ndecisions.\n    Texaco today said the SEC would urge the Texas Supreme\nCourt to accept the case for review with respect to the issue.\n    Texaco has alleged Pennzoil violated the rule when it had a\ntender offer for Getty Oil Co outstanding and then made an\nalleged agreement on January 3, 1984, to buy Getty shares.\n    Analysts said the SEC tender offer rule prevents those\nmaking the offer from entering into contracts for the target\ncompany's stock. Frederick Leuffer of C.J. Lawrence believes\nSEC intervention could be meaningful but acknowledged it could\nalso have no affect. \"If this friend of the court brief is\npotent and clearly pro-Texaco, and is taken into account by the\nTexas Supreme Court, there is a chance the entire judgment\ncould be reversed and Pennzoil gets nothing,\" Leuffer said.\n    Texaco and Pennzoil have been locked in a bitter legal\nbattle over Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil. A Texas court\nawarded Pennzoil a record 10.53 billion dlrs in damages, later\nreduced by two billion dlrs. With interest, the award now\ntotals 10.3 billion dlrs.\n    Texaco filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal\nbankruptcy laws earlier this year. Its action was designed to\navoid having a Texas appeals court order it to post a security\nbond for the entire amount of the Pennzoil judgement.\n    Texaco earlier said the SEC will file its brief the week of\nJuly 20.\n    In his comments, Leuffer also reflected the views of other\nanalysts who believe are not convinced the SEC will play a\nsignificant role. \"The other argument is the court will ignore\nit (the SEC brief) as it has all the other friend of the court\nbriefs,\" he said.\n    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Marc Cohen said he does not\nexpect the SEC's brief to change the direction of the case.\n\"Everyday, you're going to see something like this,\" Cohen\nsaid.\n    Texaco lawyer Jim Sales said it was only logical to believe\nthat the SEC would have sought to intervene in the case if it\nbelieved the 10b-13 rule was involved. \"I think what the market\nsensed today is that there is a reminder here for Pennzoil that\nthey may reach for the stars and fall on their face,\" Sales\nsaid. \"They (Pennzoil) have won every case in Texas,\" said Joel\nFischer of Drexel Burnham Lambert. But Fischer and other\nanalysts said SEC involvement may raise questions of federal\nlaw that could help Texaco take its case to the U.S. Supreme\nCourt if the Texas court does not reverse the lower opinions or\nrefuses to hear its case.\n    Analysts said the lower courts did not give much weight to\nthe 10b-13 issue.\n    Sales said the point was argued and the courts\n\"acknowledged that it was there but they really ignored the\nlegal affect of what the regulation required, and we hope we\ncan correct that misimpression\".\n    Wall Street analysts and arbitragers speculated on many\npossible outcomes. One arbitrager said there was concern that\nTexaco and Pennzoil could settle for a lower sum than demanded\nby Pennzoil.\n    \"The SEC stepping in on this issue as an amicus curiae\n(friend of the court) has a lot of arbitragers a little bit\ndisturbed,\" said Cohen.\n    \"What you're seeing is a continual chess game.
