However, the introduction of\nthe new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down.\n    Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to\nsell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.\n    U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover,\nfinance director John Edwards said.\n    A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards\nsaid the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German\ncompetitors offered an \"umbrella\" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6\nhad also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would\nrestrict the car's price.\n    Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a\n12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of\nits receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.\n    In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10\npct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct\nof net sales and training two pct.\n    Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the\nother half. The firm is in early stages of considering the\nbuilding of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg,\nbut Egan said this would take at least another three years\n    On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last\nquoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after\nreporting 1986 results which were in line with market\nexpectations, dealers said.\n REUTER...\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 09:07:54.17","topics":["earn"],"places":["uk"]},"2002":{"title":"OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM COMMON STOCK OFFERING RAISED TO 36 MLN SHARES\n","date":" 5-MAR-1987 09:18:26.80"},"2003":{"title":"CCC ACCEPTS BONUS BID ON WHEAT FLOUR TO IRAQ","body":"The Commodity Credit Corporation,\nCCC, has accepted bids for export bonuses to cover sales of\n25,000 tonnes of wheat flour to Iraq, the U.S. Agriculture\nDepartment said.\n    The department said the bonuses awarded averaged 116.84\ndlrs per tonne.\n    The shipment periods are March 15-April 20 (12,500 tonnes)\nand April 1-May 5 (12,500 tonnes).\n    The bonus awards were made to Peavey Company and will be\npaid in the form of commodities from CCC stocks, it said.\n    An additional 175,000 tonnes of wheat flour are still\navailable to Iraq under the Export Enhancement Program\ninitative announced January 7, 1987, the department said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 09:19:43.22","topics":["grain","wheat"],"places":["usa","iraq"]},"2004":{"title":"DIAMOND SHAMROCK RAISES CRUDE POSTED PRICES ONE DLR, EFFECTIVE MARCH 4, WTI NOW 17.00 DLRS/BBL\n","date":" 5-MAR-1987 09:21:58.67","topics":["crude"]},"2005":{"title":"NORD RESOURCES CORP <NRD> 4TH QTR NET","body":"Shr 19 cts vs 13 cts\n    Net 2,656,000 vs 1,712,000\n    Revs 15.4 mln vs 9,443,000\n    Avg shrs 14.1 mln vs 12.6 mln\n    Year\n    Shr 98 cts vs 77 cts\n    Net 13.8 mln vs 8,928,000\n    Revs 58.8 mln vs 48.5 mln\n    Avg shrs 14.0 mln vs 11.6 mln\n    NOTE: Shr figures adjusted for 3-for-2 split paid Feb 6,\n1987.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 09:22:57.75","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"2006":{"title":"NO QUAKE DAMAGE AT CHUQUICAMATA - MINE SPOKESMAN","body":"The earthquake which hit northern Chile\ntoday, registering 7.0 on the open-ended Richter scale, caused\nno damage to the copper mine at Chuquicamata, a mine spokesman\nsaid.\n    Chuquicamata public relations director Guillermo Barcelo\ntold Reuters by telephone from the mine that the quake had\ncaused no problems and operations continued as usual.\n    A spokesman for the state Chilean Copper Commission in\nSantiago confirmed there had been no damage at Chuquicamata.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 09:23:44.74","topics":["copper"],"places":["chile"]},"2007":{"title":"ORBIT INCREASES OIL AND GAS RESERVE VALUES","body":"<Orbit Oil and Gas Ltd> said\nthe value of its oil and gas reserves increased by 19 pct to\n52.6 mln dlrs from 44.2 mln dlrs reported at year-end 1985,\naccording to an independent appraisal.\n    Orbit said it has reserves of 2.4 mln barrels of oil and\nnatural gas liquids and 67.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas.\n    In addition, 75 pct owned <Sienna Resources Ltd> has\nCanadian reserves of 173,000 barrels of oil and 1.6 bcf of\nnatural gas with a current value of 2.2 mln dlrs, Orbit said.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 09:24:40.64","topics":["crude","nat-gas"],"places":["canada"]},"2008":{"title":"CCC ACCEPTS BONUS BID ON SEMOLINA TO EGYPT","body":"The Commodity Credit Corporation,\nCCC, has accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover a sale of\n2,000 tonnes of semolina to Egypt, the U.S. Agriculture\nDepartment said.\n    The department said the bonus was 233.91 dlrs per tonne and\nwas made to International Multifoods Corp.

The\nresults were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n    The disease is caused by a missing enzyme, called Adenosine\nDeaminase, or ADA, that is crucial to the development of the\nimmune system.\n    Enzon said it has developed a technology to coat the enzyme\nwith a substance called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, serving to\ndisguise the enzyme when it is reintroduced into the body,\npreventing rejection.\n    \"Marked improvement in laboratory tests of immune function\noccurred in each child, along with an increase in the number of\nT-lymphocytes, the immune cells that were missing before\ntreatment with PEG-ADA had begun,\" the study said.\n    \"The children are now more active and have begun to gain\nweight and height.

Only a\nprovision directing U.S. officials to vote disapproval cleared\nCongress.\n    This year's version, called the Foreign Agricultural\nInvestment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote\nagainst loans designed to increase production of surplus\ncommodities and minerals. Also, the recipient countries would\nhave to prove that the production, marketing and export of the\ncommodities could be handled without government subsidy.\n    If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the United\nStates would not increase or replenish funds for that\ninstitution until it agrees to stop making such loans.\n    Objections to such loans have most often been raised by\nconservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S.\nfunding for these international development banks.\n    But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised\nsimilar concerns among more moderate senators.\n    The administration opposes any legislation that would tie\nits hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be\ninstances in which a country needed the money to continue its\nmoves toward U.S. policies in other areas.\n    Baker said the United States would continue to use its\nleverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization\nmeasures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.\n    Two House Republicans, Representatives Larry Craig of Idaho\nand Beau Bolter of Texas, have introduced the bill.

They know\nthat controlling inflation will make industry more competitive\nand bring down unemployment in the long run,\" he added.\n    The head of another foreign bank said that only a month\nago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise\nin reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of\nraising interest rates.\n    But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now\n-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money\nfrom abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish\nexports less competitive.\n    The government says industry's competitiveness is also\nbeing hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was\nway above that of Spain's major trading partners in the\nEuropean Community, which it joined a year ago.\n    To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is\ninsisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for\nclashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough\nsacrifices.\n    Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose\ndemands essentially involve more government spending, have\nbecome an almost daily occurrence.

Don Nickles, an Oklahoma\nRepublican, said in a letter to fellow senators seeking support\nfor his legislation to limit these loans.\n    Nickles and Sen. Steven Symms, a conservative Republican\nfrom Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly\nlimit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they\nmake any loans to help developing countries produce surplus\ncommodities or minerals.\n    Current law requires the United States to vote against such\nloans but carries no reprisals if they pass anyway.\n    Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S.\npolicy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised\nat two Senate committee hearings last week.\n    Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign\nOperations, \"as a policy matter, we oppose loans for production\nof commodities in oversupply.\"\n    The senators cited a 350 mln dlr World Bank loan made to\nArgentina last year to help it increase its agricultural\nexports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.\n    Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans such\nas a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock\nexports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at\nlow interest rates for agriculture. Baker said the Argentine\nloan was \"really the only one you can point to and criticize.\"\n    Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three\ntimes over the objections of the administration to cut U.S.\nfunding of development banks by the amount of these loans.\n    Even with a favorable vote of 65 to 15, the restrictions\nwere weakened in the final version. Only a provision directing\nU.S. officials to vote disapproval was enacted into law.\n    This year's proposal, called the Foreign Agricultural\nInvestment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote\nagainst loans designed to increase production of surplus\ncommodities and minerals.\n    Also, the recipient countries would have to prove that the\nproduction, marketing and export of the commodities could be\nhandled without government subsidy.\n    If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the United\nStates would not increase or replenish funds for that\ninstitution until it agrees to stop making such loans.\n    Objections to such loans have most often been raised by\nconservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S.\nfunding for these international development banks.\n    But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised\nsimilar concerns among more moderate senators.\n    Democratic senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland told Baker\nat the Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, \"Many say the\nbanks are financing competition for American jobs.\"\n    She recommended that the United States use its\nparticipation in debt forgiveness for developing country loans\nas a wedge to open markets to U.S. goods.\n    The administration opposes any legislation that would tie\nits hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be\ninstances in which a country needed the money to continue its\nmoves toward U.S. policies in other areas.\n    Baker said the United States would continue to use its\nleverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization\nmeasures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 10:31:02.83","organisations":["worldbank"],"places":["usa","argentina","hungary","thailand"]},"2079":{"title":"AMERICAN SOFTWARE <AMSWA> SETS STOCK SPLIT","body":"American Software Inc said its board\ndeclared a three-for-two stock split on Class A and Class B\ncommon shares, payable March 31, record March 16.\n    The company said it expects to increase its semiannual\ndividend 12.5 pct to six cts per share post-split from eight\ncts pre-split.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 10:31:43.52","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"2080":{"title":"COMDATA <CDN> IN MERGER AGREEMENT","body":"Comdata Network Inc said\nit has entered into a letter of intent with a limited\npartnership managed by Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe (WCAS)\nto merge Comdata into a corproration to be formed by WCAS.\n    Comdata said in the merger each share of the company's\nstock would be converted at the holders election into either 15\ndlrs in cash or a combination of 10 dlrs in cash and a unit of\nsecurities including common stock.\n    Comdata said the terms are subject to the condition that\nWCAS' affiliate investors would own a minimum of 60 pct of the\nfully diluted stock of the new entity.\n    Comdata said WCAS and its affiliate investors would commit\n50 mln dlrs to buy the securities comprising the new entities\nunits of securities resulting from the merger in the same\nproportions and at the same price as the company shareholders.\n    Comdata said the move is subject to execution of definitive\nagreement and approval by Comdata shareholders as well as\nobtaining up to 200 mln dlrs in debt financing.\n    WCAS told Comdata it believes that it can get commitments\nfor this financing.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 10:32:49.32","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"2081":{"title":"NOEL INDUSTRIES <NOL> BOARD APPROVES FINANCING","body":"Noel Industries Inc said its board\napproved in principle a private placement of 900 units, each\nunit consisting of 1,000 dlrs of nine pct senior subordinated\nconvertible debentures due Marcxh 31, 1991, and 95 warrants to\npurchase Noel common.\n    The company said chief executive officer Leon Ruchlamer has\nsupplemented the planned funding with 300,000 dlrs.\n    It said the investment package is subject to shareholder\napproval and will be presented to its adjourned shareholder\nmeeting on March 26.\n    Noel said proceeds will be used for additional working\ncapital and expanding its factory in Kingston, Jamaica.\n    It said the debentures, which will be priced at 100 pct,\nwill have interest payable semi-annually and be convertible\ninto common after April 30, 1987, at seven dlrs a share.\n    Each warrant will be exercisable after April 30 at 7.50\ndlrs a share, the company added.\n    It said holders of 80 pct of the units may request one\nregistration by the company kof the underlying common shares\nany time after Jan 15, 1988.

of England again fought against\nmoney and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate\ncut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise\nin its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.\n    It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct\nof its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued\nto buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and\nthe possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.\n    Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can\nstop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want\nto.\n    The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants\nrates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when\nit lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to\nrelieve a money market shortage.\n    \"They're really making the discount houses suffer,\" said\nStephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew.\n\"Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.\"\n    This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by\nany sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had\ninhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came\nstrongly into the pound.\n    The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London\nclose, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60\nmarks, up from 2.8720/50.\n    \"If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that\nrates could drop before the Budget,\" said Jeremy Hale, economist\nat finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.\n    Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the\nbase rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.\n    However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be\nconvinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating\nrather than a result of short-term speculative gains.\n    There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said\nPeter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.\n    Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of\na Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and\ndisappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to\nhold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback\nfor bonds, Fellner said.\n    An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most\nforecasts say it will be this year.\n    Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to\noil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.\n    However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set\nthe timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.\n    The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable\nrate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.\n    Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least\na proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term\ncapital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.\n    They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet\nthan the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and\ncurrent political upheavals in Washington.\n    The Bank may want to see another few points on the\ntrade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. \"But by\nthen sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of\nEngland,\" he added.\n    The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting\npressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources\nsaid the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more\nthan just marking up by foreign exchange traders.\n    Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially\nharmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that\nthe current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.\n    This was above previous estimates of the current account\ndeficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.\n    Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would\nhave given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they\nwere too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.\n    The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing\nbanks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank\nofficials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this\nweek, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.\nIf a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point\ncut, with another half or full point about Budget day.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 12:14:29.54","topics":["interest"],"places":["uk"]},"2229":{"title":"BALDRIGE SAYS U.S. MAY

The agreement\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\n    \"You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,\nand that was well before Plaza,\" he said.\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\n    \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\nlaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\n    \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\nedge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want\nmy objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our\ntrade imbalance.

The move complicated a USAir\ntakeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to\naccepting the bid.\n    Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and\nsaid the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its\ntakeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.\n    Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was\noff 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread\nit would be taken over.\n    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt\nto either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a\nsuitor who might want both airlines once they merged.\n   \"The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or\nPiedmont and USAir announce a deal,\" speculated one arbitrager.\n    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current\nprice of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will\nsucceed.\n    Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk\nSouthern Corp <NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the\ncompany. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of\nPiedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.\n    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of\nPiedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is\ndestined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the\nleast likely to be bought.\n    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in\nthe airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a\nthree-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.\n    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's\noffer, which lacked financing and was riddled with\ncontingencies.\n    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two\nairlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.\n    \"You can't discount him,\" said one arbitrager.\n    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is\nserious by following through with his threats or making a new\noffer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go\ndirectly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower\nprice if USAir rejected his offer.\n    \"It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing,\" said\none arbitrager.\n    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by\nabout six dlrs per share.\n    Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline\ncombination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but\nothers believe it could be cleared if the companies are\nacquired separately.\n    \"TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to\nwork,\" said one analyst.\n    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and\ncomplicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn\nsucceeded in winning concessions from its unions.\n    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage\nscale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,\nanalysts said.\n    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they\nsaid. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines'\ncosts when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a\nnecessary ingredient for a merger to work.\n    However, other analysts speculated the managements of\nPiedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new\ncompany. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way\nfor him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged\ninto TWA.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 14:56:56.45","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"2376":{"title":"BAKER INT'L <BKO> HOPES TO COMPLETE MERGER","body":"Baker International Corp treasurer Eric\nMattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in a proposed\nmerger with Hughes Tool Co <HT> but declined to say if or what\ncompromises might be acceptable to it.\n    The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr\noilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday when\nHughes management, balking at the terms of a government consent\ndecree, offered a counter-proposal to Baker.\n    Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting\ncalled to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and said\nit hoped to resume negotitations with Baker.\n    Hughes chairman W.A.

Farmers and others in\nagribusiness can now achieve the benefits of price stability by\ntrading in option markets,\" the paper, written by Clemson\nUniversity professor Kandice Kahl, said.\n    Critics of farm programs contend that options offer the\nbenefits of price support programs without entailing the cost\nto taxpayers.\n    Kahl's paper urged farmers to buy \"put\" options in order to\nobtain the right to sell at a particular price to the private\nseller of the option contract.\n    \"This gives the farmer a guaranteed price, but still allows\nhim to profit from higher market prices, if they are available,\nby foregoing his option,\" Kahl said.\n    Interest in promoting understanding of options trading\namong farmers also has been stirred in Congress by a proposed\nchange in agricultural policy that would have the effect of\nexposing participants in federal farm programs to fluctuations\nin income subsidies.\n    The proposal -- supported by the Reagan administration and\na cross-section of lawmakers -- would allow farmers to receive\nat least 92 pct of their income subsidies regardless of how\nmuch they planted.\n    Under current law, farmers enrolled in federal price\nstabilization programs receive income subsidies, or deficiency\npayments, equal to the difference between a set target price\nand the higher of the support price or market price.\n    The so-called decoupling plan, or \"0/92\", would aim to\ncurtail surplus production by eliminating the requirement that\nfarmers plant in order to receive deficiency payments.\n    Critics of \"0/92\" plan contend that if the scheme succeeded\nin curbing surplus output, market prices would rise and\ndeficiency payments fall -- leaving farmers who chose not to\nplant with shrunken income subsidies and no crops to sell.\n    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), who has been in the\nforefront of efforts to decouple income support from acreage\nplantings, advocates replacing the variable deficiency payment\nwith a fixed and gradually declining payment.\n    But many farm state lawmakers are turned off by the idea of\noffering fixed subsidies to farmers who plant nothing.\n    Some congressional staff members said they are intrigued by\nthe notion of having the federal government subsidize the\npurchase of \"call\" options to help farmers hedge their income\nrisk.\n    By buying a call option, the farmer would obtain the right\nto buy a commodity at a particular price. If the market price\nrose above that option price, the farmer could exercise the\noption and sell the commodity on the spot market, making up\nmost of the reduction in the deficiency payment.\n    An aide to Boschwitz said the senator might offer\nlegislation linking options and decoupling, but that it might\nhave to await the results of a pilot project on futures and\noptions trading mandated by the 1985 farm bill.\n    The bill required USDA, in association with the Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission, to conduct a pilot program in at\nleast 40 counties which produce major program crops.\n    The program, only recently launched, was designed to\nencourage producers to participate in futures and options\nmarkets and to ensure that producers' net returns would not\nfall below the county loan level for the crops in question.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 17:46:11.82","places":["usa"]},"2515":{"title":"SOUTH AFRICAN FIRM TO CONTINUE TESTS","body":"South Africa's state-owned energy\nfirm Soekor said it would continue tests after striking oil\nsome 120 kms (75 miles) south-southwest of Mossel Bay.\n    During production tests, about 5,000 barrels of oil and\nfive mln cubic feet of gas per day were produced, it said.\n    \"This oil discovery will be followed-up as soon as possible\nby further seismic surveys and drilling.

Farmers can\nforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the\nloan.\n    \"We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are\nstarting to harvest and starting to export,\" Eshleman said. But\nhe added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below\n10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.\n    Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel\nBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much\nas it can this year because of its economic situation.\n    He said the debt situation was a major consideration. \"The\nBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for\nstorage,\" he added.\n    Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil\nwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said\nit would not make a big difference.\n    On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be\nmuted no matter its need to generate capital.\n    Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which\ncould limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The\ncountry may have oversold and be unable to honor export\ncommitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by\nconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will\ngive it little room to stretch exports, they said.\n    Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of\nsurplus. \"Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it\nfell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and\nfind many more markets for it,\" one analyst said.\n    \"If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would\ncollapse and they can't afford to do that,\" she added.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 18:02:33.22","topics":["coffee","oilseed","soybean","trade","sugar","cocoa"],"organisations":["ico-coffee"],"places":["usa","brazil"]},"2522":{"title":"IEA SAYS OPEC FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT 16.1 MLN BPD","body":"OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels\nper day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the\nprevious month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter\n1986, the International Energy Agency said.\n    A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production\nquotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings\nwere reduced from several countries, it said in its latest\nmonthly oil market report.\n    These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to\nfixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for\nfixed volumes over an extended period.\n    It gave this breakdown for OPEC crude output, in mln bpd\n                    FOURTH QTR 1986  JANUARY 1987  FEBRUARY\n1987\n    SAUDI ARABIA    4.9              3.7           3.8\n    IRAN            1.6              2.2           1.9\n    IRAQ            1.6              1.6           1.7\n    UAE             1.3              1.2           1.2\n    KUWAIT          1.0              1.0           1.0\n    NEUTRAL ZONE    0.5              0.4           0.4\n    QATAR           0.3              0.3           0.2\n    NIGERIA         1.3              1.2           1.2\n    LIBYA           1.0              1.0           1.0\n                    FOURTH QTR 1986  JANUARY 1987  FEBRUARY\n1987\n    ALGERIA         0.6              0.6           0.6\n    GABON           0.1              0.2           0.2\n    VENEZUELA       1.6              1.6           1.6\n    ECUADOR         0.2              0.2           0.2\n    INDONESIA       1.3              1.2           1.2\n    TOTAL           17.3             16.5          16.1\n    The IEA said while Saudi production stayed below its quota\nof 4.133 mln bpd, actual sales might exceed output due to\nNorbec stock disposals.

This is going to raise some eyebrows\nat the Fed,\" McCarthy said.\n    Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, \"We\nhave some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It's\ncoming in a lot weaker than I thought.\"    \n    The economists were quick to caution that one month's data\nprove nothing, especially because money growth previously had\nbeen so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct\nrate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.\n    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be\nexplained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the\nbooming stock market and is thus not an indication of a\nslowdown in the business expansion.\n    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond\nmarkets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a\nreflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.\n    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with\nsigns that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter\nprogresses. \"Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as\nthey were a month ago,\" he noted.\n    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and\nrises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.\n    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct\nor less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate\nenough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national\nproduct for the first quarter proved to be weak. \"You'd\ncertainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past.\"\n    There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balance\nsheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under\nway, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line\nwith expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.\n    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc\nargued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to\nsolve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive trade\ndeficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar\ndepreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to\nclose the trade gap, Brusca said \"I'm not prepared to be all\nthat optimistic about the bond market.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 19:21:55.64","topics":["money-supply"],"places":["usa"]},"2555":{"title":"ECUADOR'S CONSUMER PRICES RISE 2.5 PCT IN FEBRUARY","body":"Ecuador's consumer price index rose 2.5\npct in February to 562.4 (base 1978), the National Statistics\nand Census Institute said.\n    The rise compared to a 1.8 pct rise in January and a 2.5\npct rise in February 1986.\n    The Institute said accumulated overall inflation for the\nfirst two months of this year was 4.0 pct compared to 5.0 pct\nfor the same period last year.\n    Inflation for the 12 months ending February 1987 was 25.5\npct compared to 13.0 pct for the 12 months ending February\n1986.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 5-MAR-1987 20:45:15.41","topics":["cpi"],"places":["ecuador"]},"2556":{"title":"NATIONAL OPPOSITION AHEAD IN N.Z.

Funaro\nlast night concluded this week's tour of European capitals\nhaving gleaned little in the way of concrete support from\ngovernments for his country's attempts to find a radical\nsolution to its debt payments crisis.\n    However, banking sources noted the existence of\nconsiderable sympathy for Brazil's position among most of its\ncommercial bank creditors, manifested in the widespread belief\nthat adopting a hard line could only exacerbate the problems\nwhile patience might pave the way for an eventual\nreconciliation.\n    Brazil on February 20 unilaterally suspended interest\npayments on its 68 billion dlr debt to commercial banks,\nfollowed by moves related to around 15 billion dlrs of bank and\ntrade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions.\n    The action had been preceded by a significant deterioration\nin Brazil's balance of payments situation in the final quarter\nof 1986, along with a marked acceleration in inflation.\nReserves had dipped to below four billion dlrs.\n    Funaro and central bank president Francisco Gros last week\nvisited Washington to explain Brazil's move to government\nofficials and agencies.\n    This week they have sought official support in the U.K.,\nFrance, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.\n    They have now decided to extend their tour, flying on\nSunday to Tokyo to talk to government officials, with a\npossible visit to Canada before they return home.\n    Funaro and Gros have so far confined their consultations to\ngovernment representatives, believing that problems with\nBrazil's 109

Canadian bonds last year, have adapted to the\nchanges by buying longer term provincial issues and shifting to\nthe medium term issues offered by Ottawa.\n    \"Their (Japanese) buying over the course of the last six\nmonths has been very much concentrated in the medium term\nmaturities,\" noted one Canadian bond trader who asked not to be\nidentified.\n    Yet there was some concern a shortage could eventually\ndevelop for bonds that mature in 10 or more years.\n    Said David Gluskin, vice-president of Nesbitt Thomson\nBongard Inc, \"When interest rates finally seem to have stopped\ngoing down, there is going to be a flood of people trying to\nlock in the long end and not everyone will be able to get in\nthe door.\"\n    But bonds analysts said at the moment with interest rates\ntrending down, investors appear to welcome the change,\nespecially the greater treasury bill financing.\n    \"The wholesale market in treasury bills is very active,\"\nsaid Michael Berry, vice-president of the securities firm,\nWalwyn Stodgell Cohran Murray Ltd.\n    The change also improves receptivity in the market for\nother borrowers, including provincial governments, the big\nutilities and corporations.\n    \"There doesn't seem to any lack of bonds in the longer end\nnow, that also may be the result that any percieved shortage\nhas probably been taken up by provincial funding activities,\"\ncommented Berry.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 6-MAR-1987 15:25:21.22","places":["canada","japan"]},"2825":{"title":"EPITOPE INC <EPTO> 1ST QTR DEC 31 LOSS","body":"Shr

PROBLEMS","body":"Strikes by Brazil's 40,000\nseamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing\nmajor headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt\ncrisis.\n    A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25\nyears and union leaders say they have seriously affected\nBrazilian exports by making idle 160 ships.\n    On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest\npayments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp\ndeterioration in its trade balance.\n    Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most\npetrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrial\nheartland, and in three other states closed down to press for\nhigher fuel prices.\n    There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages\ncould lead to a serious fuel shortage.\n    The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the\n72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras.\n    The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today\nentitled \"Dangerous Confrontation,\" said: \"From the economic\npoint of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost,\nwith grave consequences for the supply situation and for the\ncountry's external trade.\"\n    The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected\noffers of up to 100 pct.\n    Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due\nto rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal. But a senior\nofficial of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao\nFranco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless\nof the tribunal's ruling.\n    Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse\nover the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan price\nfreeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not\nonly workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station\nowners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao\nPaulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.\n    Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of\nCuritiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for\nexceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions.\n    Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their\nprofits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (six\nU.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents).\n    Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last\nnight as motorists filled up their tanks while they still\ncould.\n    Political sources said the government of President Jose\nSarney was closely following the strikes and the overall fuel\nsupply situation.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 6-MAR-1987 15:32:37.81","topics":["ship","gas"],"places":["brazil"]},"2829":{"title":"FIRST UNION <FUNC> STARTS INVESTMENT NEWSLETTER","body":"First Union Corp said its\nCapital Management Group has begun publishing an investment\nnewsletter targeted to private investors.\n    The newsletter, Vision, will be published every three\nweeks.

So\n(the sale) does make a lot of sense,\" Mote said.\n    However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest\nEncor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale\nproceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to\nCommerce Bank.\n    \"I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as\nthey can,\" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.\n    Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to\nblock such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.\n    \"Other creditors generally all want to make sure that\nsomething they might be able to get a piece of is not being\nsold out from under them,\" said analyst Gobert.\n    Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint\nliability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic\nPetroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.\n    Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the\npossible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.\n    Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's\ndebt and has a \"right of consent\" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's\nholding.\n    Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares\nwould seek some

Japanese banks are\nsetting up a jointly owned firm to which they will transfer\nsome LDC loans in a bid to strengthen their balance sheets,\nimprove financial management and get tax breaks.    \n    But bankers said a move toward a greater governmental role\nwill be gradual. \"The process is such that you cannot expect\ntangible progress in a short period of time,\" one banker said.\n    Certainly, Funaro got a frosty reception in Washington and\nseveral European capitals in the past week when he called on\ngovernment officials to explain Brazil's crusade for a\npolitical dialogue on debt.\n    Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford, for\ninstance, criticized what he called large-scale solutions such\nas debt forgiveness or the creation of new multilateral lending\nagencies.\n    \"While such approaches may have some political appeal, they\nare impractical and ultimately counterproductive,\" Mulford told\na House subcommittee this week. He could have added that any\nproposal that might be construed as a bail-out of U.S. banks\nwould be a non-starter in Congress.\n    But bankers said the Reagan Administration could promote\naccounting and regulatory changes to foster debt-equity swaps\nand debt securitization and to enable banks to consider\ninterest capitalization as an alternative to new loans.\n    Experts say the government must also make it easier for\nbanks gradually to write down their third-world loan books.\n    Mulford, in his Congressional testsimony, urged the banks\nto explore different options. \"The banks should be encouraged\nto look at the so-called menu approach,\" he said.\n    Bankers said the aim would be to keep the loan syndicates\nintact or, conversely, to allow small banks to write off their\nexposure in a way that is not detrimental to major lenders.\n    Big banks say it is unfair that small creditors continue to\nreceive interest on old debt even if they do not contribute to\nnew loans. In effect, large banks say they are making new loans\nthat fund the interest payments on the old debt.\n    To solve this problem - and to streamline the cumbersome\nnegotiating process - Argentina has revived the idea of \"exit\nbonds\", which would be issued at a discount to small creditors\nin exchange for their existing debt, bankers said. The banks\nwould be rid of the loans but would have to recognize a loss.\n    Amid the swirl of new ideas, even the role of the\ncommercial bank advisory committees has come under scrutiny.\n    The principle of consensus on which the panels operate was\nchallenged recently when Citibank - ironically, the original\narchitect of the committee system - stubbornly refused for a\ntime to endorse financing offers to the Philippines and Chile.\n    The strains have not gone unnoticed in Washington. \"There\ndoes seem to be a lot of speculation about the frailty of the\nbank advisory committees,\" a U.S. official said.\n    Brazil's Funaro heavily criticized the panels in London on\nMonday, charging that they are unresponsive to new ideas and\nthat U.S. banks are over-represented on them.\n    Hannes Androsch, chairman of Austria's\nCreditanstalt-Bankverein, said there was some truth to the\ncharge. \"Sentiment is growing in Europe that we're no longer\nprepared to bail out the U.S. banks,\" he told reporters in New\nYork this week.\n    While U.S. bankers obviously see things differently, some\nhave started to wonder whether the advisory committee is still\nthe right tool for the job.\n    \"The debt crisis has probably evolved beyond the capacity\nof commercial banks alone, at least in some cases,\" one top New\nYork rescheduler said.\n    But, with governments unable or unwilling to play a larger\nrole, bankers see no alternative to the advisory committee.\n    \"It's the worst form of government there is apart from all\nthe others,\" one banker said, paraphrasing former British prime\nminister Winston Churchill's opinion about democracy.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 6-MAR-1987 16:31:16.36","places":["usa","brazil"]},"2879":{"title":"U.S. TO SELL ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT TO S.

first time and\nwarned Tokyo its promised economic package in April must be\nsignificant, senior U.S. Officials said.\n    In high-level talks last week, the U.S. Criticised Japan's\noverall fiscal policy as deflationary and argued that its\nfiscal position is not as dire as it says.\n    The criticism reflects a growing feeling among some U.S.\nPolicy-makers that Japan's tight fiscal policy is frustrating\nattempts to stimulate domestic demand and boost imports.\n    The U.S. Attack represents a distinct shift by the\nconservative Reagan administration, which until recently has\nbeen sympathetic to Tokyo's efforts to reduce the government\nrole in the economy, diplomats said.\n    Pointing out that Japan pledged in Paris last month to take\naction to boost demand, a senior U.S. Treasury official said\nthe April package must be more than routine.\n    Japanese government bureaucrats have already said they do\nnot expect the package to contain much more than a rehash of\nlast April's measures.\n    That means accelerated public investment, lower interest\nrates on government housing loans and measures to pass along\nthe benefits of the strong yen to consumers, none of which\nwould have a major immediate economic impact.\n    Several Japanese officials agreed that the real obstacle to\nstimulating the economy is the fiscal policy pursued by the\nFinance Ministry and said they welcomed the shift in U.S.\nPolicy.\n    But they expressed concern that the move might backfire by\nfanning resentment against U.S. Interference in domestic\naffairs.\n    Makoto Kuroda, vice minister for international affairs at\nthe Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said Japan\nwould stimulate the economy not in response to U.S. Criticism,\nbut to meet mounting pressure from Japanese businessmen.\n    The shift in U.S. Policy is also causing some nervousness\nwithin the Reagan administration.\n    U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen\nWallis told reporters last week the U.S. Does not necessarily\nwant an increase in Japan's budget deficit.\n    \"There are many measures Japan could take to stimulate its\neconomy,\" he said.\n    The argument is not new and has been raised in the past by\nthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n    What is new is U.S. Backing for the position.\n    At last week's talks, Japanese

enough to ask for,\nand receive, the figures supporting the new U.S. Position, a\nsenior U.S. Official said.\n    Other western officials are not so sure.
