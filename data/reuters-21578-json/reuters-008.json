The payments would\ncost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.\n    The administration sugar proposal is expected to be\nintroduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.\nJohn Porter, R-Ill.\n    Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it\nis unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because\npolitically-influential sugar and corn growers\nand high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.\n    The direct payment plan outlined by the administration \ntargets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually\nlowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment\nany output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.\n    For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower\nwould receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3\ncts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.\n    The income payments would be based on the amount of\ncommercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985\nor 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.\n    Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes\nin the sugar program because the current high price support is\ncausing adverse trends in the sugar industry.\n    He said the current program has artificially stimulated\ndomestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed\ncorn sweeteners to make market inroads.\n    U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a\n\"progressive contraction\" of the sugar import quota to only one\nmln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar\nrefiners who rely on imported sugar processing.\n    Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives\noverseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a\ncompetitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of\nsugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing\nfacilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.\n    USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on\nU.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said\nconsumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than\nnecessary for sugar.\n    \"Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between\nsweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse\nimpacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently\nfacing,\" Myers said.\n    The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per\nlb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons\nrecoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal to\ncompensate sugar growers with targeted payments.\n    QUANTITY            1988     1989      1990      1991\nFirst 350 tons         6.000    4.500     3.000     1.500\nOver 350 to 700        5.750    4.313     2.875     1.438\nOver 700 to 1,000      5.500    4.125     2.750     1.375\nOver 1,000 to 1,500    5.000    3.750     2.500     1.250\nOver 1,500 to 3,000    4.500    3.375     2.250     1.125\nOver 3,000 to 6,000    3.500    2.625     1.750     0.875\nOver 6,000 to 10,000   2.250    1.688     1.125     0.563\nOver 10,000 to 20,000  0.500    0.375     0.250     0.125\nOver 20,000 tons        nil      nil       nil       nil \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"20-MAR-1987 17:00:29.12","topics":["sugar","grain","corn"],"places":["usa"]},"8005":{"title":"<OE INC> 4TH QTR NET","body":"Shr 24 cts vs 26 cts\n    Net 1.5 mln vs 1.3 mln\n    Revs 40.5 mln vs 33.5 mln\n    Year\n    Shr 80 cts vs 82 cts\n    Net 4.9 mln vs 4.1 mln\n    Revs 143.0 mln vs 121.1 mln\n    Avg shrs 6.1 mln vs 5.0 mln\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"20-MAR-1987 17:00:52.39","topics":["earn"],"places":["canada"]},"8006":{"title":"TEXAS INSTRUMENTS <TXN> BEGINS BUILDING PLANT","body":"Texas Instruments Inc said construction\nwill begin in April on a new plant near Denton, Texas, on 193\nacres owned by the company.\n    It said the plant will initially employ between 1,000 and\n1,500 people, and will be used by its Defense Systems and\nElectronics Group for producing electronic equipemnt.

The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory\nfinancing facility and a structural adjustment facility.\n    The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed,\nBolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the\nnext 12 months.\n    Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980,\nopened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris\nClub and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of\nBolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt.\n    Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the\nnegotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be\nfinalised, had been extremely successful.\n    Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule\nBolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and\nhad waived all interest payments until the end of 1988.\n    Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said.\n    Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in\ndisbursements this year from lender countries and international\nagencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put\nthe figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs.\n    Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are\naround 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor\nPaz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the\ncapital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had\nchanged from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net\ninflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986.\n    Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz\nestenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited\ninflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were\nlosing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on\nthe black market at up to 16 times its official rate.\n    Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market-\nrelated rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off\nthousands of workers in state corporations.\n    Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past\nsix months, according to the Central Bank, and the government \nexpects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct\ncontraction over the last six years.\n    The government is also proposing a novel solution to its\ndebt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest\nhas not been paid since March, 1984.\n    Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would\nmake a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at\nthe price it trades on the international secondary market -- \n10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank\nsteering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider\nthe proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the\ncountry's creditor banks will take up the offer.\n    One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to\nbuy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the\ndeal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans\nto the country.\n    But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a\nscheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated\nin Chile for the past two years.\n    The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for\ndebt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to\nprivatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve\nas a basis for such a scheme.\n    Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove\nattractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the\ngovernment realises that it will have to attract a large amount\nof new capital in order to grow.\n    Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters\nthat Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new\ninvestment over the next 10 to 12 years.\n    The government realises that in order to remain viable,\nBolivia will need to develop new exports.\n    The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of\nBolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets,\nand gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundant\nsupply in the region.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"20-MAR-1987

Rubber\nAgreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stock\nas the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding\nexport quotas or production controls.\n    The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under\nthe auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD).\n    In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble\nthose contained in the present one.\n    The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore\ncts per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now and\nOctober 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of the\ndaily market indicator price remains above the upper\nintervention (\"may sell\") price (231 cts) or below the lower\nintervention (\"may buy\") price (171 cts) for six months.\n    If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely\nconsidering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts\n-- the price would be revised under the current accord by five\npct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber\nCouncil decides.\n    The new reference price would then be taken over for the\nnew agreement.\n    Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference\nprice would be automatically revised by five pct unless the\nCouncil decides on a higher percentage.\n    Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to\n300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, the\nreference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless\nthe Council decides on a higher percentage.\n    Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price\nreviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18.\n    Those changes are intended to make the reference price more\nresponsive to market trends.\n    As in the present accord the \"may buy\" and \"may sell\" levels\nare set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the\n\"must buy\" and \"must sell\" levels at 20 pct of it.\n    The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling\nprices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless the\nCouncil decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months.\n    During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposal\nthat the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock,\ncurrently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.\n    The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the\nsame as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provision\nfor an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes.\n    Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will be\nbrought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price.\n    At last Friday's session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking for\nproducers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact\nhad served the purpose for which it had been created.\n    Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers,\nagreed that the current agreement had worked \"relatively well.\"\n    Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA,\ndelegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accord\nhad maintained the average price above the \"must buy\" level.\n    They said the agreement until now did not appear to have\nencouraged excessive production of rubber.\n    In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer\nstock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. \"It is a\nsort of middle-of-the-road agreement,\" one delegate said.\n    The new pact will be open for signature at U.N.\nHeadquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year.\n    To become operational, it will require ratification

These spreads will\nhave to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.\n    West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged\nthe U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the\nBundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid\nweakening the dollar.\n    West German economists see room for further cuts in leading\nWest German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.\n    \"It's not a taboo,\" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank\nAG said.\n    But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates\nonly in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation\nwill limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.\n    The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already\nnearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50\npct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April.\n Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to\nshift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move\nwould tend to flatten the yield curve between short and\nlong-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the\nBundesbank lowered its discount rate.\n    It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as\nthe shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow\ngrowth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate.\n    But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West\nGerman tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to\nmeet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may\nforce interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must\nbe filled by higher government borrowing.\n    This may not occur if private sector demand for credit\nremains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.\n    Economists said it appeared the government had already\nstepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from\nother sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than\nexpected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.\n    Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German\nIfo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987\ntax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the\nWest German government in November.\n    Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up.\nBut coupled with other factors such as waning foreign\nspeculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, long\nterm yields may to have to rise, economists said.\n    Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to\nincreases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package.\n    The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in\n1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.\n    West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased\nborrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.\n    Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he\nwas looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as\nraising indirect taxes.\n    But few economists believe the government will be able to\ngo through with its tax measures without increasing net\nborrowing.\n    The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was\nwrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986\ncould be managed without increasing deficits.\n    The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed\na large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final\nquarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.\n    The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of\nthe fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion\nmarks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it\nhad not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"23-MAR-1987 03:01:41.93","topics":["interest"],"places":["west-germany","usa","japan"]},"8138":{"title":"PHILIPPINES POSTS 68 MLN DLR JANUARY TRADE DEFICIT","body":"The Philippines posted a trade deficit\nof 68 mln dlrs in January, compared with deficits of 57 mln in\nJanuary 1986 and 28 mln in December, government figures show.\n    The National Census and Statistics Office (NCSO) said\nimports of 436 mln dlrs in January were up from 371 mln in\nJanuary 1986 and 393 mln dlrs in December, while exports of 368\nmln were up on the 314 mln in January 1986 but lower than\nDecember's 421 mln.\n    The country's 1987-92 medium-term development plan targets\na 9.8 pct average annual growth in exports and a 10.7 pct\ngrowth in imports, the NCSO said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"23-MAR-1987 03:07:51.02","topics":["trade"],"places":["philippines"]},"8139":{"title":"NAKASONE DEFENDS SALES TAX AS CAMPAIGNING BEGINS","body":"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defended\nhis tax reform plans from fierce opposition, even within his\nown party, as campaigning for local elections began.\n    \"Our plan to reform the nation's tax system is by no means\nwrong.

CRISIS HITS UGANDAN COFFEE BOARD","body":"Uganda's state-run Coffee Marketing\nBoard (CMB) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past two\nmonths due to a bottleneck in export shipments and\nadministrative delays in handling payments, trade sources said.\n    The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (the\nequivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers and\nprocessors for coffee already delivered, but its present export\nrevenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said.\n    The board's cash crisis has serious implications for the\neconomy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct of\nUganda's total exports.\n    The CMB's financial difficulties first started in January\nfollowing delays in rail-freighting export consignments of\ncoffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga.\n    These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in\nUganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan\nwagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and\nTanzanian railway systems, the sources said\n    Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publicly\nacknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to\nlocal suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for\nmoving exports.\n    Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze\nwould be resolved in two weeks.\n    However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies between\nthe Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out\nof action between February 21 and March 15, causing fresh\ndelays in cargo movements.\n    Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption\nof rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned\ntheir haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs.\n    Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB\nwas holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags.\n    These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda's\nexpected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September)\ncrop, the sources said.\n    According to the sources, the board's financial problems\nhave been aggravated by long delays in processing export\nreceipts.\n    The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle\nexport receipts into payments to local producers, whereas\nexport bills handled by local banks took half that time to\nprocess, they said.\n    The sources said the CMB's price structure had been\novertaken by Uganda's high inflation rate, unofficially\nestimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a further\ndisincentive to producers, already owed large arrears.\n    \"The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months\nbehind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and the\nsooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, the\nbetter

AMT will contest all three points.\n    The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the\nwinding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will\nargue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold\nsaid.\n    The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an\narbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the\ncourt accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to\nenforce an arbitration ruling.\n    The court originally decided that the winding-up petition\nwent wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT\nspokesman said.\n    The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but\na case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be\nheard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a\nreceiver appointed over the ITC's assets.\n    Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is\npossible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be\nconsolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said.\n    Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the\nCouncil's member states and an application by the governments\nto strike out the first of these, brought by J.H.

And,\nalthough the 43-year old Cassoni has considerable experience\nrunning Olivetti's successful computer operations, analysts\nexpressed concern about his approach to ATT's business.\n    Cassoni has said he wants to acheive recognizable success\nin both within ATT and in the marketplace within two years and\nit is widely assumed that he will rapidly abandon any product\nthat does not meet those profitability goals.\n     The problem with such a strategy, analysts said, is that\nit may not give certain products enough time to become\nestablished and customers may be reluctant to buy a product\nthat could be discontinued in a year or two.\n    ATT chairman James Olson took a slightly more conservative\nview of the computer division recently. He lauded Cassoni's two\nyear goal but said he expects the data systems division to turn\naround within five years.\n    Olson denied the perception that ATT was retreating \"to the\nwomb, going back to our old business\" of long distance\ntelephone systems at the expense of the computer division.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"23-MAR-1987 14:19:17.97","places":["usa"]},"8440":{"title":"IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER, OIL TARGETS","body":"Iraq said today its warplnes had\nattacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to\nkeep up such raids until the Gulf war ends.\n    The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations\nbroke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.\n    It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad\nhailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian\nyear which ended on Saturday.\n    A high command communique said warplanes hit the western\njetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and\nstruck a supertanker nearby at the same time.\n    The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August\n1985, was last raided in January.\n    The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said\ncolumns of smoke were seen billowing from it.\n    In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian\ntanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier\nGulf attack.\n    But there has been no independent confirmation of today's\nsupertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by\nBaghdad in the past 24 hours.\n    The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight,\nwhen the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg.\n    Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at\nNowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50\nmiles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said.\n    The three oilfields have been raided several times in the\npast three years.

But is\nthere a risk? Yes, the mood out there is pretty nasty,\" one New\nYork banker commented.\n    Two or three years ago, a showdown between the world's\nlargest debtor and its largest creditors would have sent shock\nwaves through the financial markets. But no longer.\n    Some U.S. money-center bank stocks fell by about 10 pct in\nthe immediate aftermath of Brazil's payments halt. But, in the\nEurodeposit markets, which bankers consider to be the most\nsensitive gauge of confidence, there was no discernible flight\nout of bank instruments and into safer government bonds.\n    In fact, the system has calmly withstood the suspension, in\npart or in full, of interest payments by countries owing about\n150 billion dlrs of the region's total foreign debt of 380\nbillion.\n    Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala and\nNicaragua had all curtailed payments before Brazil.\n    The explanation for the fairly relaxed view is that net new\nbank lending to Latin America has dried up at the same time as\nbanks have steadily bolstered their capital base. As a result,\nexposure relative to capital has fallen and few now fear for\nthe collapse of a major bank.\n    That is why, banking analysts have said, Citicorp <CCI>\nfelt emboldened to state early in the day that it might put\nBrazil on a cash basis even before interest becomes 90 days\noverdue. It would forfeit 190 mln dlrs of profits this year as\na result, but for a company which earned over a billion dlrs in\n1986 the setback would be manageable.\n    Some other banks are not as strong, however, and a\nprotracted confrontation with Brazil could still seriously\nerode depositor and investor confidence, especially if other\ndebtors are emboldened to follow suit and press for debt relief.\n    Bankers are thus working hard to isolate Brazil.

reforms of the bank would resume\naround the fringes of the semiannual meeting of the\nInternational Monetary Fund in two weeks time.\n    But Baker said his compromise proposal, which he would not\ndisclose, was no longer on the table.\n    \"I made it clear that the proposal was not one that I\nexpected to leave out there if we could not resolve it at this\nmeeting,\" Baker said.\n    The U.S. had pressed for virtual veto power over IADB loans\nwhich were made on terms Washington considers far too lax.\n    In a bid to integrate the Bank into the U.S. debt strategy,\nWashington has suggested it would be ready to subscribe nine\nbillion dlrs to a new four-year capital replenishment of the\nBank.\n    In return Latin nations would have to give up their 54 pct\nsimple majority voting power over IADB lending.\n    Baker said, \"In my view, they have not rejected it out of\nhand at all and that it will be considered, should we choose to\nadvance it at the April meeting.\"\n    A U.S. contribution of that size would lead to an effective\nfour-year lending program by the Bank of 22.9 billion dlrs.\n    The actual capital increase would amount to 27 billion\ndlrs, but usable resources would be less because the callable\ncapital of Latin debtors is theoretical and does not take place\nin practice, U.S. officials explained.\n    In return Latin nations would have to give up their 54 pct\nsimple majority voting power over IADB lending.\n    Initially, the U.S. wanted 65 pct of votes to proceed with\na loan, a position that would have given the U.S. a virtual\nveto since it holds almost 35 pct of the votes.\n    But it seemed clear from Baker's remarks he was at one\npoint ready to concede an increased voting power, such as 62.5\npct or 60 pct as the majority for approving loans, that would\namount to a compromise between the original U.S. and Latin\nAmerican positions.\n    Baker said, \"In my view, they have not rejected it out of\nhand at all and that it will be considered, should we choose to\nadvance it at the April meeting.\"\n    Baker made clear that since Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela and\nArgentina, representing the Latins, had declined to accept the\nplan today, the U.S. had reverted to its original position, but\nhe added, \"It's possible the proposal could be revived.\"\n    U.S. officials, who asked not to be named, said they\nbelieved a decision was not forthcoming because several top\nLatin finance officials were absent from the IADB annual\nmeetings here.\n    And one official added that the key Latin officials would\nbe present at the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World\nBank.\n    The Treasury Secretary warned that if the issue is left\nunresolved \"we can't look towards a greater (capital)\nreplenishment here.\"\n    That would mean the U.S. would use another multilateral\ndevelopment bank, like the World Bank, as its principal vehicle\nfor lending tied to fundamental economic reforms in debtor\nnations.\n    The IADB has tended to make loans for projects rather than\nsectoral loans aimed at reforming Latin economies and hence has\nnever fully participated in Baker's third world debt plan.\n

\"several\nbillion,\" after a surplus of 2.82 billion in 1985 which followed\nsix years of deficits, including a record 17 billion yuan\nshortfall in 1979. They have not given an exact figure.\n    The officials blamed the deficit on excessive investment in\nfixed assets and consumer demand, a drop in efficiency in state\nfirms, a trade deficit and lower income from import duties.\n    \"China needs a nationwide campaign to increase production\nwhile cutting expenditure,\" the official Peking Review said in\nan editorial yesterday.\n    \"China should institute means for the effective control of\nthe macro-economy and the invigoration of enterprises, larger\nones in particular, by emphasising quality, efficiency and\nreduced consumption,\" it said.\n    Only by such measures, the magazine said, \"can an overall\nsupply-demand balance in society be secured and the economy\ndevelop steadily over a long period.\"\n    A Western diplomat said major factors for the deficit,\nwhich he estimated at up to nine billion yuan, were a drop in\nefficiency and wage rises in state firms, whose profits and\ntaxes account for a substantial part of national revenue.\n    The State Statistical Bureau (SSB) last month said profits\nand taxes of state firms in 1986 fell 0.2 pct from 1985 to\n119.3 billion yuan, while production costs were over budget,\nlosses rose and product quality was unstable.\n    The SSB said profits in most state firms fell because of\nbad management and rapid changes in external conditions.\n    \"For some materials, state firms have to compete on the free\nmarket, where prices are up to double those for materials they\nbuy under fixed quota from the state,\" the diplomat said.\n    \"The firms are not subject to proper market discipline,\nbecause they cannot go bankrupt, do not have to repay bank\nloans and have to employ workers whether or not they need them.\nUnder these conditions, they cannot properly adjust to the\neconomic levers the state is introducing,\" he said.\n    Another diplomat said Wang's major problem is excess demand\nin the economy, caused by wage increases well ahead of\nindustrial growth, and excess growth in capital construction.\n    \"He must dampen this growth through raising taxes or cutting\ngovernment expenditure,\" he said. \"China's economy is inherently\nunstable, either in a high or a trough.\"\n    He said Wang will reaffirm themes repeated by leaders since\nthe start of the year -- thrift, improved efficiency, cutting\ninvestment outside the state plan and reducing consumption to\nbring demand and supply into balance.\n    \"There will be no surprises,\" the diplomat said.\n    The first diplomat said one sign of the thrifty times was\nthe lack of a banquet during a visit he made to a major Chinese\nindustrial city.\n    \"Normally, a foreign guest's visit is a chance for the boys\nto feast on Mao Tai (a strong liquor), turtle and sea slugs,\nwith one banquet given by them and one given in return by me.\nBut there was none on this visit,\" he said.\n    He added economic reforms will slow this year, in\nparticular price changes and the issuing of shares, which raise\nsensitive issues about ownership and ideology. Bond issues\nraise no such dilemmas and will continue, he added.\n    A North American banker, who estimated the deficit at about\neight billion yuan, said economic policy has been affected by a\nnational drive against \"bourgeois liberalism,\" a phrase meaning\nWestern political ideas.\n    \"In China the political system dictates economic policy,\" he\nsaid. \"The large deficit gives the conservatives a stick to beat\nthe reformers and demand more economic austerity.\n    \"One of China's top economic policy makers told me this week\n1987 will be a year of consolidation for his firm, with less\noverseas investment, lower imports and new funding to be\nsourced internally.\"\n    The banker said he is more comfortable about China's\nstability now than two months ago, when the drive was launched\nafter the resignation of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang.\n    \"There is no leftist alternative to the reforms,\" he said.\n\"There is no going back to the policy of strict central control.\nBut the reforms will take years.

Even excluding volatile defense\ngoods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency\nsaid.\n    The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many\nfinancial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to\nincreases of up to five pct.\n    The January/February employment statistics suggest the\nGross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for\nthe first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an\neconomist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n    The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,\nthe lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm\njobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in\nJanuary and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.\n    The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of\nabout three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.\n    Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding\ntheir inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the\nsecond quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the\nsecond quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption\nand government spending. He also sees residential construction\ndeclining mostly for multi-family housing units.\n    Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the\nfourth quarter slowness will continue.\n    Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the\nfirst quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and\nshow a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.\n    The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the\nU.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in\nthe dollar's value over the last year and half.\n    \"The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,\" Levy\npredicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at\nleast one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the\nprices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.\n    The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,\nwhich soared to record levels last year, will improve this year\nand the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the\nyear compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.\n    As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.\nhas been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their\ndomestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.\n    U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the\npressure off the United States whose five years of economic\ngrowth has been the mainstay of developing countries.\n    The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for\ntheir goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to\nservice their foreign debt.\n    The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a\nmodest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.\n    There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance\nbetween the volume of goods imported to the United States and\nthose shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of\nexports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact\nthat in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened\nduring the closing three months of 1986.\n    While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate\nprofits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the\ngovernment said. It also reported that inflation, as measured\nby the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a\nmoderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.\n    The government also reported that consumer spending, a key\nelement of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in\nFebruary, after falling two pct in January.\n    The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the\nmanufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements\nof the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.\n    In its latest report on current economic conditions, the\nFed said that economic activity in the various regions of the\ncountry ranged from uneven or steady to improving.\nManufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most\nregions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.\n    Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the\npick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the\ndrop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a major\npick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy\nwill slip into recession either.\n    He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts\nthat have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze\nconsumers purchasing power.\n    \"That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of\nyears,\" Chimerine said.

victory for the oil companies\nand the Reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasing\nprogram and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that\nchallenged the leases by claiming damage to

Administration officials, saying the lease sales were\npreceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that\nthe oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources.\n    The Alaskan

Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the\ncurrent year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline\nin output from the major Brent field, he said.\n    Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas\nliquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to\nbe maintained in 1987, he said.\n    A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey\nNorth Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months,\nReid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5\nbillion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil\nprice fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.\n    Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North\nSea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the\ncost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.\n    Day to day operating costs of the exploration and\nproduction sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target\nis to keep costs per barrel constant.\n    The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to\nthe discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to\ngauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.\n    Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a\nprofit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.\n    Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit <Shell\nU.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987\nwere a \"bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.\"\n    In November and December in particular, refining operations\nhad shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil\nproduct prices, he said. He expected margins to continue\ngenerally positive over the summer, although they could dip to\nbecome negative from time to time, depending on price\nmovements.\n    A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery will\nnow come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five\nmonths behind schedule, following a crane accident which\nseverely damaged the plant last year, he said.\n    Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from\n11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical\nsite.\n    Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which\ncompanies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying\ndevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields against\nPRT, was \"helpful,\" but rather less than had been hoped for.\n    Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in\nthe range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he\nwould expect some over-production above OPEC\"s official 15.8 mln\nbpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.\n    He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain\noutput was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance,\nbut the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will\nfall.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"24-MAR-1987 11:34:02.03","topics":["earn","crude","nat-gas"],"places":["uk"]},"8821":{"title":"VOLKSWAGEN U.S. MID-MARCH CAR SALES DOWN","body":"Volkswagen U.S. Inc said its mid-March\ncar sales fell 35 pct from the same period last year.\n    Volkswagen said it sold 1,330 cars in the March 11-20\nperiod, down from 2,047 last year.\n    For the first two March sales periods, Volkswagen sold\n2,179 U.S. cars, down 23.7 pct from 2,856 last year.

A\nnotable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became\naffiliated with Cargill, Inc.\n    Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional\ncooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist,\nof Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries\nin Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and\nHarvest States in Minneapolis.\n    Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative\nFutures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.\n    Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives\nare forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one\ncash house at the Chicago Board of Trade.\n    Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm\ncooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few\nmajor commercial companies are growing dominant, he said.\n    Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the\nNational Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives\nexist today, down from 6,700 five years ago.\n    \"The period we've gone through in the past five years has\nbeen quite a crunch,\" he said. \"There's been a lot of\nconsolidation in the marketing co-ops.\"\n    One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the\nmajor commercials for export, rather than exporting it\nthemselves, losing potential profits.\n    But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the\nmulti-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers\nExport Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served \"to make\nfolks gun-shy,\" Hanes said.\n    Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is\napproved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather\nthan a change in U.S. agricultural economics.\n    A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm\n\"was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of\nmoney. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of\ndoing business.\"\n    \"We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,\" he said.\n\"But there are lot of people out there to do business with.\nThere are plenty of capable firms.\"\n    Steven W.

In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op\nreported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0\nmln dlrs.

We (the banks) wanted more money and they (the\nSouth Africans) didn't want to pay.\"\n    The new agreement will extend for three years the\nstandstill arrangement that has been in place since August 1985\nand which was due to expire on June 30.\n    Depending on the maturity of the various debts, banks will\nreceive on July 15 repayments representing three pct of the\narrears and the overdue debt covered by the standstill.\n    It also will require the repayment over the life of the\nstandstill of another 10 pct of the overdue debt spread over\nsix month invervals and depending on the maturity of the\nvarious debts for a total of slightly more than 1.4 billion\ndlrs.\n    Last year South Africa repaid about 500 mln dlrs out of the\n14 billion dlrs covered by the standstill. At the time, bankers\nhad argued - unsuccessfully - for a larger repayment given the\ncountry's trade surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs.\n    Bankers had hoped that this time they could secure an even\nlarger repayment of around one billion dlrs. Although there had\nbeen speculation that the standstill would be extended for\nthree years, many did not believe that a long term pact would\nbe acceptable to U.S. banks. Those banks have taken a hard line\nin the negotiations because of America's strong anti-apartheid\npolicies.\n    The agreement reached today differs very little from the\none reached a little over a year ago. However, it does include\none moderation of an option contained in that pact which\nintroduces yet another \"catchphrase\" into the jargon for\nreschedulings.\n    The new agreement contains an \"exit vehicle\" under which\nbanks can convert their debt into 10 year loans. Under the\nprevious agreement banks were only given options for three year\nloans.\n    While the option may be unpalatable to the U.S. banks, it\ncould offer others a potential repayment of slightly more than\nhalf their investment over the next seven years.\n    To convert the debts, a bank would have to find a borrower\nlooking for a loan with a 10-year maturity and then negotiate\nindividually the interest rates to be charged.\n    The loans would not represent any new money and as the loan\nwould be the obligation of the new borrower there would be a\nrepayment stream that could give the bank as much as 52 pct of\nface value by year seven, one banker said.\n    Bankers suggested that depending on a banks' political and\neconomic forecasts for South Africa, if it decided to take the\noption it may not have much difficulty finding such borrowers.\nThey noted that South Africa's Public Investment Commission is\nan active borrower in this area of the market.\n    Today's agreement was reached between South Africa's chief\ndebt negotiator Chris Stals, who chairs its Standstill\nCoordinating Commmittee and representatives of the 12 banks on\nthe commercial bank technical committee.\n    The bankers said that telexes will be sent today to the\ncountry's other 330 bank creditors and that documentation\ncovering the proposal will be mailed out shortly.\n    Because of the banks' sensitivity to South Africa's\napartheid regime, the previous negotiations were conducted with\nFritz Leutwiler, the former head of the Swiss National Bank,\nacting as mediator.\n    Leutwiler was not involved with these talks and has not\ninvolved himself in the negotiations since last year, the\nbankers said.\n    Last time, the banks sent their responses on the proposal\nto Leutwiler who in turn notified the South Africans. This time\nthe procedure will be less structured and will be up to the\nindividual banks as to how they wish to handle it.\n    Although talks had been held in recent weeks between the\nSouth Africans and the banks, the completion of the agreement\non the repayments took many in the financial community by\nsurprise.\n    A review of South Africa's economy by the technical\ncommittee's economic sub-committee was to be held in February\nwhile the talks for the rescheduling were due to start some\ntime this month or next month.\n    However, the bankers said that because of all the publicity\nwhich surrounds South African debt negotiations, the meetings\nwere kept secret.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"24-MAR-1987 15:27:14.80","places":["uk","south-africa"]},"8981":{"title":"WEAN UNITED INC <WID> 4TH QTR","body":"Shr loss one dlr vs profit seven cts\n    Net loss 3.0 mln vs profit 349,000\n    Revs 35.6 mln vs 49.3 mln\n    Year\n    Shr loss 2.87 dlrs vs loss 2.71 dlrs\n    Net loss 8.4 mln vs loss 7.9 mln\n    Revs 140.3 mln vs 169.2 mln\n    NOTE:earnings reflect preferred dividend requirements, 1986\nyear includes one-time gain of 1.2 mln dlrs\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"24-MAR-1987 15:29:37.84","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"8982":{"title":"U.S. HOUSE PANEL EASES SOVIET EXPORT CONTROLS","body":"The U.S. House Foreign Affairs\nCommittee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now\nkept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer a\nthreat to U.S. national security.\n    The Democratic-controlled committee said the\nadministration's export control policies, which restrict\nshipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year's\nrecord 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit.\n    The committee said the legislation will cut government red\ntape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with\nforeign producers since many of the goods are readily available\nfrom other countries.\n    Rep.
