But the bank nearly\ntrebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to\n60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985.\n    Other results released so far show <Saudi American Bank>\n(SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7\nmln riyals, while <Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi\nFrench, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals.\n    Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's <CCI.N>\nCitibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez,\nincreased provisions sharply.\n    <Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1\nmln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln\nriyals.\n    Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non-\nperforming loans has stopped growing as the decline in the\nSaudi economy bottoms out.\n    Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic\nactivity, but one banker said \"The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks\nare now at or close to international levels on provisions.\"\n    From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank <National\nCommercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in\nprovisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the\nprivate sector, bankers calculated.\n    Between 1982 and 1985, <Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as the\nsecond biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had\ncovered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate\non an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine.\n    Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been\ntightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for\ndeclaring loans as non-performing.\n    Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures\ndifficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest\nas revenue while others follow more conservative practices in\nforce in major world financial centres.\n    Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the\njoint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank\nas the strongest earners.\n    Other banks such as <Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by\nthe <British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a\nrelatively low deposit base.\n    Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln\nriyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another\nlow figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most\nconservative in making provisions.\n    Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a\nSaudi bank go under and not only supported <Saudi Cairo Bank>\nafter its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made\navailable cheap deposits to <Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB.\n    The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but\ngenerally banks are awash with liquidity since they are\nunwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans.\n    And while banks in more liberal financial markets can\nattempt to diversify away from traditional lending,\nconservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate\nfee income from new investment banking products.\n    One banker said \"Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not\ngood.\"\n    Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of\nadvances is showing a declining trend, while the days when\nbanks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to\ninvest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return\non their money.\n    In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current\naccounts was 27 to 73 pct.

Japanese bank economists\npolled by Reuters said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is\nlikely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising\nexports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. \"The\neconomy will bottom out in the middle of the year,\" said\nSumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido.\n    Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu\nTaketomi agreed. \"It (the bottom) is in the offing,\" he said.\n    But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the\nfiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct,\nfrom two pct in the current year, he said.\n    Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst\nare increasing.\n    The volume of exports in the first two months of the year\nrose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward\nthe end of last year.\n    Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a\nsharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks,\nseveral economists said it could mark the beginning of a\nrecovery.\n    Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller\nthan expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3\npct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey\nreleased last week showed that the decline in Japanese\ncorporate earnings may be nearing its end.\n    And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes\nthe rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said.\n    Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And\nWest Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise\ncurrencies around current levels.\n    The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two\nyears has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its\ncompanies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market.\n    \"The important thing is the exchange rate,\" Taketomi said.\n    If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise\ninvestment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs\nof that yet, economists said.\n    A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their\ncompetitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to\nrecover, economists said.\n    Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some\nloosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo\nMuto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.\n    The next reading of the economy's health should come early\nnext week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter,\n1986.\n    Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from\nthe previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct.\n    But a senior government official said the fourth quarter\nfigures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point\nquarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical\naberration and not a significant shift in economic activity.\n    To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the\neconomy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth\nquarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong.\n     The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a\nstatistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of\n1986, the official said.\n    Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also\ndistorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second\nhalf of 1986.\n    Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their\npurchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer\nexpenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December\nbecause of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year\nbonuses, they said.\n    As the government had to buy back some of the coins from\nretailers because they were unsold, the government's\ncontribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been\nboosted, economists said.\n    Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from\ngovernment buying of farm products as the domestic crop last\nyear was good.\n    The senior government official said the fourth quarter\nperformance of the domestic sector was probably worse than\ngenerally expected, while that of the external sector was\nbetter.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"12-MAR-1987 09:01:08.51","topics":["gnp"],"places":["japan"]},"4166":{"title":"NEW U.K. POLL SAYS TORIES HAVE SIX-POINT LEAD","body":"Britain's ruling Conservatives have\nmoved into a six-point lead over the main opposition Labour\nParty, a Marplan poll published in today's Guardian newspaper\nreports.\n    The Conservatives are shown with a 38 pct share of the vote\nagainst 32 pct for Labour and 27 pct for the centrist\nSocial-Democratic/Liberal Alliance.\n    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has until June, 1988 to\ncall a general election, but most political analysts expect her\nto go to the country some time this year.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"12-MAR-1987 09:05:29.00","places":["uk"]},"4167":{"title":"QINTEX EXTENDS PRINCEVILLE <PVDC> OFFER","body":"<Qintex America Ltd> said it is again\nextending its offer of 13 dlrs a share for 3.3 mln Princeville\nDevelopment Corp shares until today from yesterday.\n    As reported yesterday, Qintex said, about seven mln\nPrinceville shares had been tendered in response to the offer.\n    Qintex said it is extending the offer to allow Princeville\nto comply with federal law restricting the ownership of U.S.\nairlines by non-U.S. citizens and to finalize the terms and\nconditions of the letter of credit or bank guarantee required\nunder the previously announced acquisition agreement.\n   \n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"12-MAR-1987 09:05:55.13","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"4168":{"title":"JM BYGGNADS SHARES SUSPENDED ON STOCKHOLM BOURSE","body":"Shares in building firm <JM Byggnads\noch Fastighets AB> were suspended on the Stockholm bourse at\nthe company's own request, the bourse said.\n    The suspension will last until the end of trading on\nFriday, the bourse added in a statement, but gave no further\ndetails.\n    JM is half-owned by Skanska AB <SKBS ST>, which has offered\nto buy out the remaining stock, but analysts said JM could have\nbeen approached with a rival bid.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"12-MAR-1987 09:06:37.77","places":["sweden"]},"4169":{"title":"CORRECTED-NETWORK VIDEO INC <NVID> 3RD QTR","body":"Feb 28 end\n    Shr five cts vs one ct\n    Net 161,019 vs 50,745\n    Revs 1,048,543 vs 478,700\n    Avg shrs 3,217,500 vs 4,350,000\n    Nine mths\n    Shr 12 cts vs four cts\n    Net 390,179 vs 169,275\n    Revs 2,658,692 vs 1,478,066\n    Avg shrs 3,217,500 vs 4,350,000\n    NOTE: Corrects reversed figures in March 11 item.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"12-MAR-1987 09:07:47.09","topics":["earn"],"places":["usa"]},"4170":{"title":"BANKERS OPPOSE STRICT TAIWAN CURRENCY CONTROLS","body":"Taiwan imposed currency controls today\nin what bankers called a desperate move to prevent speculation\nas the Taiwan dollar appreciated against the U.S. currency.\n    The strict controls will require proof that large\nremittances to Taiwan are connected to commercial transactions\nrather than currency speculation.\n    Bankers attacked the controls as ineffective, saying they\nwere a panic reaction to pressure from Washington for faster\nappreciation of the Taiwan currency against the U.S. dollar,\nwhich would slow exports to the United States.\n    Remittances exceeding one mln dlrs earned through exports,\nshipping, insurance or bank lending will now need government\napproval, along with remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from\nany other source.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"12-MAR-1987 09:09:49.42","topics":["money-fx"],"places":["taiwan"]},"4171":{"title":"SAUDI SUPERTANKER REPORTED HIT BY IRAN OFF UAE","body":"Iran attacked the Saudi Arabian\nsupertanker Arabian Sea off the United Arab Emirates last night\nbut the vessel was able to proceed after the incident, Lloyds\nShipping Intelligence reported.\n    The 315,695-dwt Arabian Sea had set sail on Tuesday after\nloading oil at the Saudi port of Ras Tannurah.

But January's\nsales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously\nreported 5.8 pct decline.\n    \"The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a\nmuch more sluggish pace,\" said Don Maude of Midland Montagu\nCapital Markets Inc.\n    Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data\nover past four months to show that the pace of consumer\nspending is slowing.\n    Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November\nand a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain\nover the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4\npct rise for year-over-year sales through February.\n    \"You can see a pattern developing,\" Maude said. \"I wouldn't\nbe surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales\nprobably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in\nFebruary.\"\n    Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were\nimpressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding\nautos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline\nin January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline.\n    \"The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains\nin durable goods as well as non-durables,\" noted Ward McCarthy\nof Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. \"It was a pretty healthy\nreport.\"\n    He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February\nafter falling 1.7 pct in January.

This followed a 27.7 pct drop\nin January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely\nto the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws\nJanuary 1, the Commerce Department noted.\n    Some economists argued that the because the gain in total\nsales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the\nstrength in the February report is less than impressive.\n    \"There is strength in the February data, but that's because\nthey were compared to low sales levels in January,\" said said\nBeth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"We don't see it as a\nprecursor of continued strength.\"\n    Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling\n17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained\n1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January.\n    Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February,\nfollowing a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher\noil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales\nprobably accounted for these gains.\n    Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending\nis weakening.

proposal a \"reflection of a\nlargely political decision,\" adding \"we have no confidence in\nInterior to represent the broad public interest in this area.\"\n    Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain\nto oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough \nsafeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen.\n    It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold\nbillions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as\nan energy resource would never be known without exploration.\n    Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10\nbillion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain.\n    Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas\nexploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a\nwildlife refuge protected from commercial development.\n    Hair said Interior's report failed to stress the\nprobability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct.\n    He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas,\nfish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered\nnor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection\nAgency on the possible effects of exploration.\n    The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a\nnine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the\nissue and report back to Congress in about two years.\n    Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible\nexploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate to\nmake a sound judgement.\n    Congressional observers said that at present there was\nlittle sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for\ncommercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the\nUnited States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil.\n

June, 30, 1987, or\nit will be difficult to close the (farm credit system) books.\"\n    Billington's loss prediction is gloomier than either the\nsystem or its regulator had previously admitted.\n    The system itself has so far predicted losses for all of\n1987 will reach only 1.1 billion dlrs, down from 1.9 billion in\n1986 and 2.7 billion in 1985.\n    However, Billington said the system is

held at the end of 1986.\n    The system also has 4.2 billion dlrs in capital held by its\nmember borrowers, called borrower stock, which theoretically\ncould be used as capital.\n    Billington said by the end of 1987, more than 1.6 billion\ndlrs of the 4.2 billion in borrower stock would be downgraded\nin value because of the mounting losses.\n    Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, urged

However, the sources noted\na late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which\nflourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more\nlikely from late July on.\n    This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices\nmean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and\ninsecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot.\n    A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over\n500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said.\n    Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage,\nestimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely\nvulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0\nmln bag mark if the disease hits.\n    Although flowering was good following the start of the\nrains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because\nthe drought had caused a drop in the insect population which\npollinates flowers, the sources said.\n    However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are\nnow generally back to near normal levels and that current\nflowering and pod setting is good, which should result in\nmature fruit from August through September.\n    The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of\nbeans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the\nmain crop, which officially starts on October 1.\n    \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go\nwell from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break\nfrom August through November or even December,\" one said.\n    If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove\naccurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the\npast 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when\nprolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln\nbags, the lowest since 1974.\n    Good growing conditions the following year produced a\ntemporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag\nrecord, while last year's output, which also suffered some\ndrought damage, was 2.77 mln bags.\n    Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards\nby the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans.\n    The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to\nhave been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and\nthey were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the\nend of the official crop year on April 30.\n    Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the\ninclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port\nwarehouses but not declared.\n    Because of the high turnover of beans this year,\nsignificant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored\ntoo long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected\nto be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals.\n    With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and\nmain crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks\nstill to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be\nat least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared,\nthe sources said.\n    This would compare with the previous record set last year\nof 6.03 mln.\n    However, there is no way of telling how many current crop\nbeans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao\nand thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be\nofficially registered.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"12-MAR-1987 15:34:34.08","topics":["cocoa"],"places":["brazil"]},"4471":{"title":"ANHEUSER-BUSCH <BUD> DEBENTURES ISSUED","body":"Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc said it will\nissue 150 mln dlrs in principal amount of 8-1/2 pct sinking\nfund debentures due March 1, 2017.\n    It said the offering will be through an underwriting\nsyndicate managed by Dillon, Read and Co Inc.

Gardner said he believes a better offer might be\nfound if the company would agree to be sold to some other\nentity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier\ndivision.\n    \"Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has\n450 mln dlrs in revenues.

A group of Fidelity\ncompanies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he\npersonally owns 20,000 shares.\n    A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the\nletter from Gardner.\n    Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service\nmay emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the\ntransaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also\nspeculated another courier company would be the most likely\nsuitor.\n    While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no\nnew bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed\nthe stock into play again.\n    \"There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a question\nof management's willingness to let the process continue,\" said\none arbitrager.\n    Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they\nbelieve Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.\nHutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs\ncash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be bought\nfor securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.\ncourier operations.\n    The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that\nHutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and\nwill emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in\nPurolator.\n    \"As far as I can tell from the public documents from the\ndeal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.\nOne always likes a situation like that. You always like to\nthink if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be\nsomeone else in the world that could do it higher,\" said one\narbitrager.\n    The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and\nsources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the\nfirm will not end up paying for its equity position.\n    While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document\ndid note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to\nkeep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some\nrisk to the firm.\n    \"There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,\nand all sorts of things that make it very speculative,\" said\none of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to\nemployees.\n    The E.F.

released by the Federal Reserve\ntoday clearly indicate that policy is \"on hold\" and may not be\nchanged for weeks or even months, economists said.\n    \"The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not\nabout to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs\non the economy,\" said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co.\n    \"These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in\nprospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue for\npolicy change,\" said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc.\n    Fed data released today were all in line with economists'\nexpectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks.\n    The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two\nweeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mln\ndlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changed\nfrom 160 mln dlrs in the period before that.\n    It said that banks' net free reserves in the latest two\nweeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously.\n    Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800\nmln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6\nbillion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs.\n    Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3\npct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actual\npositive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3.\n    February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and\n20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits\nset by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is\n5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target.\n    \"In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the\nFed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money\ngrowth,\" said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government\nSecurities Inc.\n    Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary\ngrowth in March after February's anemic growth rates. However,\nthey stress that money growth will not be strong enough to\nprevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the\neconomy shows evidence of weakness.\n    Commenting on February's decline in the key M-2 aggregate,\nSlifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money\nmarket deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four\nbillion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February's\nweakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2\nand M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March.\n    Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return\nto the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so\ncontinue to present no problem for the Fed.\n    Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with\nits current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps\nseveral more months of economic data before deciding whether or\nnot to ease its grip on reserves.\n    Given the economy's fragility in many sectors, the analysts\nagreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose\nto raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next\nchanges policy.\n    \"Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as\nlow as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six\npct,\" said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct\nin the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week.\n    The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of\ncustomer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on\nMonday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added\nreserves directly through two-day System repurchases.\n    Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate\nbe largely market-driven. They said it is focusing instead on a\nborrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"12-MAR-1987 18:32:12.03","topics":["money-supply","interest"],"places":["usa"]},"4603":{"title":"COLOMBIA'S COFFEE MARKETING TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE","body":"Colombia intends to improve the\nmarketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on\nsetting export registration prices, finance minister Cesar\nGaviria said.\n    Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export\nregistration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock\nNew York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile.\n    \"In the first stage, we decided not only to lower the\nreintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that\nwill allow private exporters to participate more actively in\nColombia's coffee export policy,\" he said.\n    Traders said this means the export registration price will\nchange more often in a truer reflection of market trends.\n    Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market\nfactors since a return to a system of International Coffee\nOrganisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the short\nterm.\n    ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock\nover re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February\n1986.\n    Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer\nfrom depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices\nwith increased volume.\n    \"Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of\ncoffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will do\nso without an agreement among producers,\" he said.\n    He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5\nmln bags as mentioned in market circles, \"because the idea is\nprecisely not to disrupt the market.\"\n    Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86\ncoffee year which ended last September 30.\n    Echoing Gaviria's words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of the\nnational coffee growers' federation, said Colombia sought to\nadapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances.\n    \"There is great expectation in the world for the policies\nthat Brazil and Colombia will adopt.

The two sides will meet again on Friday.\n    The talks, in which the Philippines is seeking to\nreschedule about 9.4 billion dlrs of debt, are now dominated\nby a discussion of the innovative proposal made by finance\nminister Jaime Ongpin to pay part of the country's interest\nbill in Philippine Investment Notes, PINs, instead of cash.\n    Manila wants to pay the London Interbank Offered Rate in\ncash and to issue PINs in respect of the margin above LIBOR.\n    The banks rejected the original PINs proposal last Friday,\nbut Ongpin presented a revised proposal on Monday which sought\nto satisfy the banks' objections by guaranteeing that the notes\nwould yield 7/8 pct over LIBOR in cash.    \n    The banks have apparently yet to pass final judgment on the\nnew proposal.\n    Senior Reagan Administration officials expressed warm\nsupport for the PINs proposal this week, which gave Ongpin hope\nthat the banks would embrace the idea.\n    But the banks are still being circumspect, weighing\npossible accounting consequences as well as considering the\nprecedents that they would set if they agreed to PINS.\n    One of the  main architects of the PINs proposal, U.S.\nlawyer Lee Buchheit, is adamant that the banks have nothing to\nworry about.\n    \"To the extent that it's a precedent, it's a precedent to\nbe encouraged,\" Buchheit, a partner with Cleary, Gottlieb,\nSteen and Hamilton, told a debt-equity swaps conference\nsponsored by Euromoney magazine.\n    Under the proposal, banks would sell the dollar-denominated\nPINs at a discount to multinational firms which would convert\nthem into pesos at face value to fund government-approved\nequity investments in the Philippines.\n    In effect, international firms would be paying part of\nManila's interest bill, allowing the government to conserve\nmuch-needed hard currency.\n    One of the beauties of the scheme, according to Buchheit,\nis that it widens the scope of third-world debt negotiations,\nwhich have been confined to debtors and creditors for the past\n4-1/2 years.\n    \"There's another pool of cash at the table now,\" he said.\n    David Mulford, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury,\ntold the Euromoney conference that ideas such as PINs should be\npart of a \"menu\" of options available to banks instead of pure\nnew-money packages.\n    He said the difficulty of syndicating Mexico's 7.7 billion\ndlr loan package shows that new approaches must be encouraged.\n    \"We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devising\nnew money packages may, in effect, be essential to future bank\nsyndications,\" Mulford said.\n    In an unusually frank comment about the Mexican deal, he\nsaid that dissatisfaction with Mexico's economic program and\ncriticism of communication and coordination within the bank\nsyndicate had prompted a number of banks to refuse to\nparticipate in the loan.\n    This refusal \"for a time appeared to jeopardize the\nprospects for successful agreement with the rest of the banks,\"\nMulford said.\n    The Mexican package is now due to be signed on March 20,\nbut bankers said the U.S. clearly feels the need to breathe new\nlife into the financing process, especially with crucial\nnegotiations with Brazil, about to start.\n    The banks for their part insist that they are more than\nwilling to discuss Mulford's \"menu\", and say it is the debtors\nthat need to be more flexible. For example, they say financing\ntalks with Argentina are proving tough because Buenos Aires\ndislikes the debt-equity schemes and onlending provisions that\nthe banks are promoting.

Spending and taxing decisions should\nbe linked more closely.\n    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct\ngrowth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and\n3.5 pct in 1988.\n    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of\neconomic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, \"It looks pretty\ngood to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.\"\n    He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,\n\"It looks like they're on track.\"\n    While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,\nSprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.\n    The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax\nreform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will\ngreatly increase private production incentives, he said.\n    \"Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest\nnational net output of goods and services will permanently\nincrease by approximately two pct because of the long-run\nconsequences of tax reform,\" Sprinkel said. \"In 1986, this would\nhave amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the\nincome of the average American family.\"\n    Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible\nfor the large increase in the budget deficit.\n    In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted\nto 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of\nGNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.\n    Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986\nfederal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points\nhigher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.\n    \"Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981\ntax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget\ndeficits of the past few years,\" Sprinkel said.\n    \"This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax\nincreases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,\" he added.\n    However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner\nargued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.\n    \"Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes\nenormously without any plan to decrease spending by the\nAdministration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence\nspending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)\nare unpleasant,\" he said.\n    Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological\nturmoil in the U.S. Caused by the \"biggest sustained inflation\nin our nation's history,\" which helped foster widespread\ndistrust of government.\n    \"The American people turned on the government with tax\nrevolt at the state level and new demands on the government at\nthe national level,\" Penner said.\n    \"But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike\nof spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake\ndemands that the system change a lot.\"\n    Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget\ndeficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will\nremain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.\n    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is\nnot likely to succeed.\n    \"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to\ndictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply\nbecause there's no ... Way to enforce it,\" Penner said.\n    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget\ndeficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated\nby one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes\nrelated to tax reform and sales of government assets.\n    \"Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative\ntiming changes, like moving the military payday from the last\nday of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988.

Such a\nLIFFE contract is expected later this year.\n    LIFFE liquidity could be higher than at the SIMEX, where\naverage daily volume in Treasury bonds dropped to 165 in\nFebruary from 1,286 last October when the bonds were first\nintroduced.\n    The contracts were set up to attract hedging from the\nrapidly growing underlying cash market in U.S. Treasury bonds\nin Toyko, but interest has waned as that market has grown more\nstable, traders said.\n    Restrictions on investments by Japanese residents have also\ninhibited the growth of the futures contracts in both Singapore\nand Sydney, the banking sources said.\n    Nevertheless, all 450 seats on SIMEX are now taken, with\nthe last trading at 55,000 dlrs against the initial price of\n50,000 dlrs. The current bid is 55,500 dlrs, but offers at\n65,000 show that confidence in SIMEX remains, said Michael\nKillian, general manager of Chase Manhattan Futures Corp.\n    Killian, a SIMEX board member, said the CBOT night session\nmight raise arbitrage opportunities and SIMEX would benefit\nfrom a local stock exchange index contract planned for the end\nof 1987.

Nigel\nLawson next week when he unveils his budget for fiscal 1987/88.\n    Exceptionally robust tax revenues have given Lawson very\nfavourable budget options with which to please voters, industry\nand financial markets alike.\n    The budget will Lawson's fourth, and probably the last from\nthe Conservative government before the next general election,\npolitical analysts say.\n    Analysts said the major budget question is how Lawson will\nbalance expected tax cuts with lower public borrowing, and\nallow for fresh falls in U.K. Interest rates.\n    They said a boost given to the economy by consumer spending\nhas helped reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement\n(PSBR) for financial 1986/87 from an originally targetted 7.1\nbillion stg, despite big rises in government spending.\n    Economists say Lawson may have up to five billion stg to\nsplit between income tax cuts and other electoral \"sweeteners,\"\nhigher spending and a drop in borrowing, while still meeting\nhis earlier 1987/88 PSBR target of 7.0 billion stg.\n    The decision facing Lawson is how best to use that\nso-called \"fiscal adjustement\" to maximise the government's\nall-round popularity ahead of the next general election.\n    Economist Ian Harwood of Warburg Securities said Lawson's\nbudget must strike a balance between tax cuts aimed at home\nconsumption and lower public borrowing for attracting support\nfrom overseas investors.\n    Peter Fellner of James Capel and Co said \"a budget which\nconcentrates on tax cuts for the consumer will be a budget for\nan early election.\"\n    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher must call a poll before\nJune, 1988. But anticipation of a summer or autumn 1987 ballot\nhas risen as the opposition Labour Party has slipped in voter\nsurveys. Forecasts that the economy may deteriorate later this\nyear add to arguments for an early poll, analysts say.\n    The Conservatives have pledged to cut the basic rate of\ntaxation in the U.K. From the current 29 pct level to 25 pct.\n    While confirming that aim, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\nlast month seemed to dash speculation that that would happen in\nthe near future. She said in a television interview that it\nwould happen \"Eventually. But I think it will be eventually.\"\n    Most market analysts now expect a two-pence reduction in\nthe basic rate of taxation and a lowering in of the top rate of\nincome tax from 60 pct.\n    A one billion stg cut in the 1987/88 PSBR - to six billion\nstg - is considered the minimum needed for reassuring financial\nmarkets, they add.\n    The Treasury's inflow of tax receipts has far surpassed\nthat previously envisaged, economists say. Lawson as recently\nas December 17 said that \"I very much doubt whether there will\nbe much scope for reductions in taxation in next year's budget.\"\n    The Conservative government is eager to get the basic rate\nof tax down to 25 pct as soon as possible, since every pound\noff the tax base would make the opposition Labour Party's\nspending plans look more painful to the electorate, analysts\nsay.\n    The direct revenue effect of a one penny change in the\nbasic rate of income tax would be about 1.1 billion stg in\n1987/88 and 1.45 billion stg in 1988/89, Treasury figures show.\n    Lawson's budget speech to Parliament on Tuesday starts at\n1530 GMT, and is sure to echo the government's distinct tone of\noptimism, analysts say.\n     The tax measures which Lawson is expected to announce will\nbe based firmly on a positive assessment of past economic\nachievements and confidence for the future, they add.\n    But even if he does cut his planned PSBR for 1987/88 by\nbetween one and 1.5 billion stg, as most economists predict,\nLawson is still likely to find himself announcing a higher PSBR\nthan the outturn for this financial year.^M\n    That could leave him with a presentation problem,\neconomists say.\n    A lower PSBR would raise financial confidence by reassuring\nmarkets that the borrowing burden imposed by the government\nwould stay low even if certain key aspects of the budget's\narithmetic seem over-optimistic, economists say\n    Lawson is slated to reaffirm the government's goals, as set\nout in its Medium Term Financial Strategy (MTFS), of reducing\ninflation and raising economic growth.\n    Regarding monetary targets, some analysts expect him to\ndrop the wayward broad money aggregate, sterling M-3, while\nretaining the tamer M0 narrow measure. Few foresee any other\nmonetary aggregate being chosen by Lawson for formal targeting.\n    Analysts were surprised this week when the government\nsanctioned a half percentage point cut in interest rates, in an\nattempt to cool down sterling and the gilts market. Analysts\nhad expected the authorities to wait until after the budget.\n    Further declines in bank base lending rates are anticipated\nafter the budget. Many analysts foresee them falling by as much\nas a full percentage point from the current 10.5 pct level.\n    The main electoral attraction of reducing interest rates is\nto cut mortgage borrowing costs, and thus reduce inflation,\nanalysts say. Each one percentage point cut in the mortgage\nrate reduces retail prices by 0.4 pct, government figures show.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"13-MAR-1987 05:13:44.43","places":["uk"]},"4675":{"title":"Miyazawa says current dollar/yen rate not necessarily satisfactory\n","date":"13-MAR-1987 05:15:51.05","topics":["money-fx","dlr","yen"]},"4676":{"title":"JAPAN TO WIDEN PARTICIPATION IN TELECOM SERVICES","body":"Japan agreed in talks with the U.S. To\namend its laws to allow more companies to engage in\ninternational value-added network telecommunications services,\na Post and Telecommunications Ministry official said.\n    Such services make communications between otherwise\nincompatible computers possible over telecommunications lines.\n    The official said firms registering as \"Special Type Two\nTelecommunications Firms,\" which are those leasing lines from\ncommon carriers, will be permitted to re-lease the lines to\nusers and provide international services.\n    Steps will also be taken to assure fairness in negotiations\nbetween common carriers and firms seeking to lease lines, the\nofficial said.\n    Since December, 10 companies have registered as Special\nType Two firms, including two which have American Telephone and\nTelegraph Co <T> or McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD> as major\nshareholders, the official said.\n    Currently only <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> and <Nippon\nTelegraph and Telephone Corp> are allowed to operate\ninternational telecommunications services.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"13-MAR-1987 05:16:38.71","places":["japan","usa"]},"4677":{"title":"NORDBANKEN POSTPONES PLANNED AUCTION OF FERMENTA SHARES","body":"Sweden's Nordbanken banking group\n\nsaid it would postpone indefinitely its planned auction on\nMonday of 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan collateral by\nFermenta's <FRMS ST> founder and former chief executive Reefat\nel-Sayed.\n    A statement cited Fermenta's financial position as the main\nreason for delay.

Discussions\nwith up to a dozen other airlines have not yet resulted in\npublic commitments.\n    Apart from a shortage of orders, Airbus also is facing an\nuphill struggle persuading its member governments to fund the\n2.5 billion dlr project, which involves not only the A340 but\nits sister A330 aircraft, a twin engined, wide bodied medium\nrange jet with many identical components.\n    The British government remains unconvinced that there will\nbe sufficient room in the world long range jet market.\n    The West German government is also uncommitted, and is\ncurrently pressing for a restructuring of the consortium's West\nGerman company, <Deutsche Airbus GmbH>, while only the French\ngovernment appears to be fully behind the program.\n    Another major factor delaying a final decision on the plane\nhas been the engine which will power it. Airbus agreed last\nOctober with <CFM International> that its CFM-56 engine with\n28,600 lbs of thrust would power the plane. But in December,\nAirbus announced an agreement with CFM rival <International\nAero Engine> (IAE) to power a slightly larger version of the\nA340 with a 30,000 lb thrust high-technology superfan engine.\n   Airbus has made clear to potential customers that the IAE\nengine is now the principle engine for the project.  The\nincorporation of the superfan engine made the plane on paper\nmore attractive to airlines, but the engine has yet to be\ndeveloped and CFM International had openly expressed scepticism\nthat the engine will be ready when the plane goes into service.\n    The future of the Airbus consortium depends on the right\ndecision being made on the A340 in the next few weeks, for it\ncould find itself severely exposed in the 1990s either by\nstaying absent from the long range jet market or by committing\nitself to a commercially unviable project.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"13-MAR-1987 08:04:21.28","places":["france"]},"4725":{"title":"AIRBUS HAS NINE COMMITTED CUSTOMERS FOR A330/340","body":"The European Airbus Industrie consortium\nhas obtained a total of 104 commitments from nine customers for\nits planned A340 long-range jet and A330 twin-engined\nmedium-range jet, the consortium said in a communique here.\n    Its supervisory board, meeting in Toulouse, \"concluded that\nthe commercial and industrial objectives ...

Spending and taxing decisions should\nbe linked more closely.\n    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct\ngrowth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and\n3.5 pct in 1988.\n    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of\neconomic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, \"It looks pretty\ngood to me.

Now the correction of that 1981 mistake\ndemands that the system change a lot.\"\n    Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget\ndeficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will\nremain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.\n    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is\nnot likely to succeed.\n    \"I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to\ndictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply\nbecause there's no ... Way to enforce it,\" Penner said.\n    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget\ndeficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated\nby one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes\nrelated to tax reform and sales of government assets.\n    \"Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative\ntiming changes, like moving the military payday from the last\nday of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988.

As\nyou know, there's been 8.5 billion dlrs in new money,\" said the\nofficial, who plays a key role in keeping the plan afloat.\n    The plan was launched in October 1985 by Secretary Baker\nand called on commercial and multilateral banks to lend 29\nbillion dlrs in the subsequent three years to major debtors\nundertaking reforms that promoting economic growth.\n    But it has taken almost six months to complete the\nsyndication of a 7.5 billion dlrs loan to Mexico, which has\ncreated deep misgivings here about the liklihood of such large\nstraight cash loans being assembled ever again.\n    U.S. officials want the banks not only to consider swapping\ntheir debts for equity in local corporations -- a development\nthat has already met with success in Chile and Mexico -- but to\npin loans on specific projects, finance trade and invest\ndirectly in debtor country private sectors.\n    These forms of lending, they say, give the banks a greater\nstake and more economically secure return on investment.\n    In a major challenge to the U.S. plan, Brazil last month\ndeclared a moratorium on interest payments and followed it up\nwith a world tour by officials seeking a political way out of\nits 109 billion dlr debt burden.\n    The country is beset by a falling trade surplus and\ndwindling reserves endangering its ability to service its\nforeeign debt, at 109 billion dlrs the Third World's largest.\n    One official attending the Washington talks with Brazilian\nFinance Minister Dilson Funaro said \"they've come in here now\nand said \"Look, we're out of money, help us,\" but they haven't\ncome in with a plan. And they've gone all over the world, and\nat every stop they've been told the same thing.\"\n    The official said Brazil would have to enact a credible\neconomic program, either in consultation with the World Bank or\nthe International Monetary Fund, to cool its overheated economy\nbefore commercial banks would begin negotiations.\n    As a result of the Brazilian action, private banks and\nmajor debtor nations redoubled their efforts to reach\nagreements stretching out debt repayments.\n    For its part, the administration has signaled its strong\nsupport for new techniques that in some cases effectively\namount to interest rate concessions for major debtor nations.\n    It pressed the banks to allow Chile to make annual instead\nof bi-annual interest payments, speeding an accord.\n    Administration officials, who asked not to be named, have\nalso debated whether to allow banks greater flexibility in\nbuilding up loan loss reserves against Third World loans.\n    The debate centers on a rule, known as FASB-15, under which\nbanks experiencing delayed interest payments on real estate\nloans need not set aside reserves against debt principal if it\nis believed payments will resume.\n    More recently, the rule was extended to cover farm and\nenergy loans and Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat,\nhas suggested it should be extended to Third World loans.\n    Bradley is prominent among Congressmen urging that\nprovisions for debt relief be attached to tough new trade\nlegislation now being considered on Capitol Hill.\n    But the officials said the debate has been inconclusive.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"13-MAR-1987 09:05:32.23","places":["brazil","philippines","mexico","usa"]},"4765":{"title":"<MDI MOBILE DATA INTERNATIONAL INC> YEAR NET","body":"Oper shr 63 cts vs 47 cts\n    Oper shr diluted 56 cts vs 38 cts\n    Oper net 3,284,955 vs 2,176,925\n    Revs 31.6 mln vs 23.0 mln\n    NOTE: Current oper net excludes writedown of 344,039 dlrs,\nor seven cts a share, on unidentified investment.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":"13-MAR-1987 09:06:27.37","topics":["earn"],"places":["canada"]},"4766":{"title":"APPLIED BIOSYSTEMS <ABIO> LOWERS SALES FORECAST","body":"Applied Biosystems Inc said\nit has lowered its internal product sales forecast following a\nreview of market conditions in Europe.\n    The company also said Chairman Sam Eletr has resigned for\npersonal reasons.\n    The company said it now expects third quarter, ending March\n31, sales to approximate the second quarter's 21.1 mln dlrs and\nthird quarter earnings to be less than the second quarter's 2.7\nmln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, due to unexpected European\nsoftness and previously announced new product delays.\n    Applied Biosystems earned 2,654,000 dlrs, or 20 cts a\nshare, in 1986's third quarter on sales of 13.4 mln dlrs.\n    Explaining European orders have not materialized at the\nrate expectd, the company added \"we believe that the slowness\nin orders reflects current conditions in the market for\nresearch instrumentation in Europe.\"\n    It said sales in the current quarter are also being\naffected by the previously announced delay in completion of the\nsoftware for the Model 900A Data Analysis Module.

But many economists say the system,\nwhich holds eight European Community currencies within narrow\nfluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.\n    Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has\nbeen a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike\nseeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.\n    And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as\nEurope's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality\nwhen Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.\n    But economists say members such as West Germany have so far\nblocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's\nfounding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and\nformer French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.\n    Under this phase, originally due to have started two years\nafter the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been\ntransferred from national governments and central banks to an\nautonomous European Monetary Fund.\n   But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in\neconomic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is\nthat governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a\nsituation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one\neconomist who has closely watched the system's development.\n    The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on\nthird currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the\nsystem's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.\n    Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and\ninvestors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp\nrise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE\n    As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose against\nEMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And as\nWest Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several\nEC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow\nthe mark's rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease\nfinancial and trade strains within the community.\n    Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued\nby three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct\nagainst other currencies in the system -- the French franc,\nItalian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown.\n   Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the\nEMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world\ncurrency, outside the system.\n    No change in the British government's attitude is expected\nbefore the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.\n    Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it\nwas set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's\nhighly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central\nBank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.\n    Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers\nhold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.\n    But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve\nmore than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical\nabout the chances for any fundamental change.\n    \"Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS\nagainst external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we\nmust take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leo\nde Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.\n    Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend\nlargely on the success of an agreement last month among major\nindustrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar\nresumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they\npredict.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":"13-MAR-1987 10:02:20.72","topics":["money-fx"],"organisations":["ec"],"places":["belgium","west-germany","uk"]},"4810":{"title":"GENERAL MILLS<GIS> SEES STRONG 4TH QTR RESULTS","body":"General Mills Inc, reporting\nstronger results for the third quarter ended February 22, said\nit expects the momentum to continue in the fourth quarter.\n    The company said it expects to report \"strong earnings per\nshare growth and a record return on equity in fiscal 1987.\" It\nsaid this should be achieved despite expected non-operating\ncharges in the final quarter.\n    General Mills said these charges will likely offset\nnon-operating gains, which included six cts a share in the\nfirst half.\n    General Mills said at the end of the third quarter, its\nreturn on average equity was 31.6 pct.\n    It said major factors contributing to the third quarter\nimprovement were an 11 pct gain in unit volume by Consumer\nFoods, continuing good profit growth at Red Lobster USA and\nstrong performance in Specialty Retailing.\n    The company reported quarterly earnings of 56.9 mln dlrs,\nor 64 cts a share, up from 46.4 mln dlrs, or 52 cts a share a\nyear ago.

Each has cut deeper and deeper into the very\nfibre of the market,\" said a senior official at a U.S. Bank.\n    As prices have fallen, he explained, the underwriters who\noriginally brought the issues have retreated. They have\ndivested themselves of the paper as quickly as possible,\nunwilling to bear losses of the magnitude seen in recent panic\ntrading.\n    In the virtual effective closure of the market for\nperpetual floaters last month, bankers witnessed the\nconsequences of this kind of contraction of liquidity and\ninvestor confidence.\n    Fears were engendered about the possibility of this crisis\ninfecting the market in conventional dated FRN issues, which is\nalmost 10 times as large as that for perpetuals, with an\nestimated 130 billion dlrs of debt outstanding.\n    \"The professionals are so nervous about holding inventory\nthat they will sell at any price,\" said an official at a leading\nU.S. Bank, explaining the panic selling which has pushed prices\ndown sharply over the last two days.\n    Bankers and FRN traders emphasised that today's trading was\nunique in that it was driven exclusively by professionals and\nthat there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the securities\nthey sold.\n    In highlighting this point, dealers noted that the\nbenchmark issues in the FRN market -- the two FRN's for the\nU.K., Launched in 1985 and 1986 -- fell an unprecedented 50 and\n40 basis points, respectively, at the opening this morning.\n    Certainly, dealers said, Britain is no less credit-worthy\ntoday than it was yesterday and the country's economic health\ncurrently appears better than it has for some time.\n    Pointing out that this kind of sovereign and supra-national\ndebt had not sagged on any fundamental weakness, one senior FRN\nsource said: \"The idiocy of the situation is aptly shown by the\nfact that these kind of borrowers can now tap the syndicated\nloan markets at rates lower than their floaters currently pay.\"\n    Dealers agreed that banking sector paper, which constitutes\na significant part of the market, was currently under pressure.\n    Floating rate debt of major U.S. And Canadian banks eased\nmarkedly in nervous trading last month on renewed investor\nfears about the banks' exposure to Latin American debt.\n    The U.S. And Canadian money centre bank FRNs, along with\nRepublic of Ireland paper, were hard hit again this week with\ndealers citing one heavily-traded Citicorp note falling to\nlevels so low it is now effectively yielding 55 basis points\nover Libor (the London Interbank Offered Rate).\n    By comparison, the 500 mln dlr note which matures in 1998\nyielded only a fine 20 basis point over Libid (the London\nInterbank Bid Rate) when it was issued in January last year.\n    Price declines of this size can really only be explained by\nan understanding of the operating practices of leading players\nin the market, dealers and banking analysts said.\n    \"This has to be understood as a matter between banks who\nhave a brief to buy low and sell high,\" one U.S. Bank source\nnoted.\n    Another senior source at a U.K. Bank drew attention to the\nenormous overhead costs and high salaries generated over the\nlast few years in the FRN market, which have to be justified.\n    But even beyond the cost of running an FRN trading desk,\ndealers said, is the way the securities are bought and sold.\n    Although sophisticated on-screen dealing exists in most\nmarkets, in the euro-markets trading is conducted by telephone.\n    \"If somebody calls you up and asks you to make him a price\nin any issue, and you do, he can say \"Right.

On the inflation\nfront, all is well,\" he said. \"Money supply is well under\ncontrol. It's an absolutely ideal situation.\"\n    February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly\nless than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected.\nThis compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's production\nnumber, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase.\n    The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct,\nless than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct\nrise in the PPI in January.\n    \"The Fed is going to look at this positively,\" said Allan\nLeslie of Discount Corporation. \"Certainly inflation is not as\nbad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial\nproduction growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants.\"\n    The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in\nFebruary, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.\n    \"This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation\nis behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per\nbarrel,\" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. \"The\ntrend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year.\"\n    In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct\ndecline in the PPI.\n    Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected,\nbut a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices\nfell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.\n    Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that\na possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both\nthe financial markets and the Federal Reserve.\n    \"The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations\ntoday,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.\n    While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier\nmonetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this\ncould necessitate a weaker dollar.\n    \"The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air,\" he\nsaid. \"We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with\nforeign producers.\"\n    Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct\nin February's PPI. With many electronic goods produced\noverseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising\nprices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.\n    If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish\noverseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might\nnecessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.\n    By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8\npct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to\na large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value\nof the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.\n    Slifer said import prices may rise further as\nmanufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped\nto current levels expire, and new contracts are made that\nreflect a weaker dollar.\n    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported\nmanufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the\nsecond half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.\nindustrial output.\n    \"It's the other side of the lower dollar,\" Wyss said.\n\"Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive\nand they are increasing output.\"\n    Wyss said that the latest data point to an average\nindustrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter.\n\"It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is\nbeginning to revive.\"\n    But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not \nconvinced that the February reports portend economic gains.

Some trade sources said\nrecent speculation has been that last year's Soviet grain crop\nbe revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln\nannounced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain.\n    A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect\nSoviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said.\n    Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the\nUSSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its\nArgentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln\ntonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also\ncut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes.\n    Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this\nyear's corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mln\ntonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR.\n    \"Significant downside potential\" still exists for the\nArgentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the\namount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow.\n    \"If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been\nthinking, then they might need more than what Argentina can\nprovide during the April to June period,\" he said.\n    Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked\nSoviet buying.\n    U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market\nearlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine corn\nfor 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Soviet\nsources said.\n    \"This price difference makes American corn competitive,\"\nAlbert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union,\ntold Reuters.\n    Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause\nthose prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. corn\nfutures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices have\nbottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said.\n    Finally, some industry sources said that by buying the\nminimum amount of corn guaranteed under the
