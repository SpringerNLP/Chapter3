Manufacturing\nhours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9\nhours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February.\n    The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing\njobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and \nelectronic manufacturing.\n    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a\n13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for\nnearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs.\n    Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories\nresulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with\nthe labor force and may point to slower growth ahead.\n    Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five\npct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in\nthe first-quarter GNP accounts.\n    Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two\npct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the\nsecond and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial\nactivity \"is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate\ncontribution inventory accumulation made to GNP.\"\n    Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains\nin industrial production and personal income for March.\nThey expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for\nthese indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct\nin industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income.\n    Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop\nin March construction employment may also signal a drop in\nMarch housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851\nmillion units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in\nJanuary.\n    The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level\nsince March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed\nout that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which \nfell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February.\n    \"This just means that there were fewer people looking for\nwork, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much,\" he said.\n    He said the latest employment report will not concern the\nFed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of\n2.5-3.0 pct, but \"it does suggest they can't afford to tighten\nto quickly either.\"\n    The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal\nfluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor\nforce gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them\nin January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with\nhis forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth.\n    Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think\nthat the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their\nmeeting this week. \"At some point they will be more inclined to\nease,\" he said. For the time being, however, the March\nemployment report \"increases the likelihood they won't tighten,\nregardless of the dollar.\"\n\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 3-APR-1987 14:04:52.21","topics":["money-fx"],"places":["usa"]},"13054":{"title":"BRISTOL-MYERS <BMY> REVIEWING SCIMED MERGER","body":"SciMed Life Systems Inc <SMLS> said\nBristol-Myers Co is analyzing the pending lawsuit brought\nagainst SciMed by <Advanced Cardiovascular Systems Inc> to\ndetermine whether to consummate its previously announced plans\nto merge with SciMed.\n    The company said its was served the suit in Minneapolis on\nMarch 31, the day after it announced its definitive merger\nagreement with Bristol-Myers.\n    SciMed said the suit, which alleges that SciMed infringed\non Advanced Cardiovascular patents, is without merit.\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 3-APR-1987 14:06:26.28","topics":["acq"],"places":["usa"]},"13055":{"title":"UK SEEKS PACT WITH JAPAN FOR INFORMATION EXCHANGE","body":"Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard\nsaid he will use a coming trip to Tokyo to seek a memorandum of\nunderstanding between Britain and Japan on the exchange of\ninformation to fight fraud in world financial markets.\n    He told journalists that he would be seeking an agreement\nwith Japan similar to one struck last autumn between the U.K.\nDepartment of Trade and Industry, on the one hand, and the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission on the other.\n    Market sources have persistently speculated that it was\ninformation passed on to the U.K. By the SEC through their pact\nthat triggered the DTI's investigations into (Guinness Plc's)\n<GUIN.L> takeover of <Distillers Co Plc> last year.\n    The probe, launched in December, triggered the resignation\nof some of Guinness' senior management, including Chairman\nErnest Saunders.\n    The Trade department, however, has never confirmed this and\nhas yet to state what its investigation actually concerns.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 3-APR-1987 14:07:59.28","places":["uk","japan"]},"13056":{"title":"IRAQ SAYS ITS FORCES SINK THREE IRANIAN VESSELS","body":"Iraq said its forces sank three Iranian\nboats which tried to approach its disused deep water oil\nterminal in the northern Gulf today.\n    A military spokesman, quoted by the official Iraqi news\nagency, said other Iranian boats fled.

The Committee set a six to seven pct January\nthrough March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no\nM-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a\nseven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March.\n    The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds\nrate \"reference\" range for policy, as in other recent meetings.\n    At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members\ndiscussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in\nParis for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No\nconclusions were contained in the minutes.\n    In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC\nsaid that \"somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or\nslightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable\ndepending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into\naccount the strength of the business expansion, developments in\nforeign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and\nconditions in domestic and international credit markets.\"\n    The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged\npolicy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president\nfavored some tightening of reserve conditions.\n    He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November\nthrough January and the firm federal funds rate that had\nprevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He\nalso cited the recent declines in the dollar's value.\n    Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential\nfor a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed\nthat prompt restraints might avert the need for more\nsubstantial tightening later.\n    Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC\nminutes showed, \"the members generally felt that policy\nimplementation should be especially alert to the potential need\nfor some firming of reserve conditions.\"\n    In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve\nrestraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in\nline with current expectations and there were concurrent\nindications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the\nbackground of stronger economic data.\n    One indication of potential price pressure might be a\nfurther tendency for the dollar to weaken.\n    The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer,\npreferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing\nduring the weeks ahead. However, \"most of the members did not\nwant to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during\nthe inter-meeting period, although they did not view the\nconditions for such a move as likely to emerge.\"\n    The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the\ndollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any\nsignificant effect on the Fed's economic projections.

to reinforce the European Monetary\nSystem, with all that implies,\" Belgian Finance Minister Mark\nEyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of\ninformal talks at this Belgian coastal resort.\n    The gathering was the first such discussion since the\nsecond major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in\nJanuary.\n    The system has come under severe strain as funds have\nflowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS\ncurrency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against\nweaker currencies in the system.\n    But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading\nwestern industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at\naround current levels was working and this would allow the EC\nto speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the\nEMS.\n    He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the\nneed for closer coordination among EMS member governments of\ninterest rate policies and of interest rate differentials\nbetween different countries.\n    They also agreed they needed better coordination of\nexchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both\nwhen they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their\nagreed margins.\n    But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of\ntechnical problems and ministers would discuss these further in\nLuxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's\nMonetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors.\n    He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic\nconvergence betwen Community countries and it was important\nthat interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange\nrates and inflation rates.\n    The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the\npresidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not\nproduced any agreement to move radically forward in developing\nthe EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and\nmonetary integration.\n    \"We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal\nfunctioning of the system,\" Eyskens said.\n    Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS\nhas to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise all\nmovements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go\nahead.\n    EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the\nmeeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final\nphase of capital market liberalisation in October that would\ninclude safeguard clauses for member countries for which the\nmove would create difficulties.\n    Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also\ndiscussed the need to \"dedramatise\" realignments of EMS parities\nby letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by\ntelephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers.\n    However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister\nGerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea.\n    British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told\njournalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater\ncoordination of exchange market intervention was the question\nof which currencies should be used to intervene and held in\ncentral bank reserves.\n    He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would\nwork better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an\nissue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the\nBundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves.\n    He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments\nreflected a general feeling among participants that the way the\nJanuary reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory.\n   The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and\nWest Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in\nthe

TRADE","body":"The International Cocoa Organization\n(ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the\ndowntrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying\noperations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said.\n    Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could\nreach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices\nsignificantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging\nthe market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the\nICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special\nDrawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 \"must buy\" level.\n    Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last\nmonth by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer\nstock manager has completed preparations, traders said.\n    Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer\nstock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used\nto calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average\nabove the 1,600 SDR \"must buy\" level.\n    The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of\nthe second, third and fourth positions on the London and New\nYork futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per\ntonne yesterday.\n    Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and\nSeptember, but these are set to change to July, September and\nDecember on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot\nmonth, traders noted.\n    The introduction of December into the calculations may lift\nthe daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75\nstg above May on the London terminal market.\n    But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the\nhigher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the\nindicator which governs his activities, traders said.\n    \"The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the\nimplications of delaying until forward prices lift the\nindicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,\" an\nanalyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.\n    Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000\ntonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach\nthis level within six months, buying is suspended pending an\nICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market\nwatchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent\nforecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln\nto two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to\nthree mln.\n    A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87\nworld surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared\nwith a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of\n94,000 tonnes, traders said.\n    In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to\nbuy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the\n\"must buy\" level.\n    But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put\nconstraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock\nmanager can remove cocoa from the market.\n    The buffer stock system of price differentials set\naccording to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from\nnon-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action,\ndealers said.\n    Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is\nnearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin.\n    But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as\nMalaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa\ncan only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer\nstock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.\n    Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member\ncocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are\npressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said.\n    Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from\nquality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact\non futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for\nthis cocoa over futures.\n    Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg\nfrom 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer\nstock buying, dealers said.\n    \"The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will\nprovide a backstop for quality cocoas,\" one trader said.\n    Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer\nstock were \"all prognostication\" and that no one could hope to\npredict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically\nbuffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer\nstock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the\nprevious cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers\nexpressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.\n    In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding\nscheme as an additional market support mechanism.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 06:19:55.44","topics":["cocoa"],"organisations":["icco"],"places":["uk","malaysia","brazil","ghana"]},"13463":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 06:19:58.77"},"13464":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 06:20:25.44"},"13465":{"title":"LONDON METAL PRE-MARKET OPTIONS","body":"Traders indicated single option premiums,\nsterling per tonne except silver which pence per oz unless\nstated.\n            1MTH      3MTHS     6MTHS\n COPPER     15-19     24-28     UNQUOTED\n            19-24     26-30     UNQUOTED DOLLARS\n LEAD        8-12     12-15     UNQUOTED\n ZINC        8-12     20-23     UNQUOTED\n SILVER     UNQUOTED  UNQUOTED  UNQUOTED\n ALUMINIUM  23-27     29-34     UNQUOTED\n            26-31     35-40     UNQUOTED DOLLARS\n NICKEL    2-2.75   3.50- 4.00  UNQUOTED CENTS A LB\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 06:20:40.83"},"13466":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 06:20:47.00"},"13467":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 06:20:51.78"},"13468":{"title":" German February capital account deficit 7.53 billion marks vs Jan 11.91 billion surplus - Bundesbank\n","date":" 7-APR-1987 06:21:07.51","topics":["money-supply"],"places":["west-germany"]},"13469":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 06:21:33.15"},"13470":{"title":"YIELD ON 180-DAY SAUDI DEPOSITS RISES","body":"The yield on 180-day bankers security\ndeposit accounts issued this week by the Saudi Arabian Monetary\nAgency (SAMA) rose slightly to 6.63492 pct from 6.56823 last\nweek, bankers said.\n    SAMA reduced the offer price on the 500 mln riyal issue to\n96.78906 from 96.82031 last week.

This could place a\nserious burden on several foreign banks, particularly those\nactive in primary and secondary bond markets. Foreign banks had\nmuch lower equity and reserve capital than most domestic banks.\n    Senior banking sources said talks between the Bundesbank\nand the banking supervisory office over bringing securities --\nprimarily bonds -- under banking laws governing capital ratios\nwere in progress.\n    Although no date had been set for imposition, banks as\nearly as this year may be obliged to bring bonds under 1985\nrules that limit bank lending to 18 times shareholders equity\nand reserves.\n    Although other national regulatory authorities are known to\nbe considering similar steps in light of growing securitisation\nof debt previously in the balance sheet, Germany, with its\ntradition of prudence, may be the first.\n    Brian Kissack, president of the Foreign Banks Association,\ntold Reuters, \"It's not a positive sign. It could cause certain\npeople who are not in (West Germany) to query whether it was as\nattractive to get in now.\"\n    Larger banks may begin to use global networks to pass on\nholdings in mark securities to other centres which had less\nstringent ratios, taking business out of the country, he added.\n    But sources said foreign banks faced a host of other\npractical problems as well. These included,\n    -- the apparent unwillingness of the Bonn government to\nmake an early move to abolish the stock exchange turnover tax.\n    -- signs that London's \"Big Bang\" may have deeper\nimplications for German securities trading than first thought.\n    -- difficulty in finding experienced securities\nprofessionals to staff new subsidiaries.\n    -- growing pressure on commercial banking margins that is\nforcing widespread retrenchment and refocusing of activities.\n    -- the threat of having to face a renewed push for market\nshare by the largest and most powerful Japanese banks.\n    By leaving the stock exchange turnover tax out of the\ninitial negotiating session of the incoming federal coalition\ngovernment, Bonn had dashed hopes it would soon be abolished.\n    The tax is 0.25 pct on each side of a securities trade by a\nnon-bank, but it is not levied on public authority bonds.\n    This extra cost, particularly for finely-priced instruments\nsuch as floating rate notes, had kept much mark securities\nbusiness firmly in the City, awaiting a change. But aside from\nthis, London was more active than domestic houses had expected.\n    Large U.S., British, Japanese and Swiss investors often\npreferred to execute block trades -- 50,000 shares and up --\nwith City market makers who could absorb at least some of the\npaper in their own positions, diminishing the immediate impact\non the share price.\n    Most German brokers and banks pass trades direct to the\nexchange floor, cutting profits or adding to costs.\n    Bank in Liechstenstein (Frankfurt) GmbH board member\nMichael Zapf said London's share of German securities business\ndone was causing foreign banks without German units to weigh\nwhether establishment costs involved were worth the returns.\n    Additional signs that London market makers may move into\nsecondary level stocks had added to this concern, he said.\n    Now, plans by many foreign banks to transfer mark\nsecurities trading entirely to newly established, mainly\nFrankfurt-based units were being reassessed, sources said.\n    The continuing existence of the stock exchange tax had also\neffectively prevented the birth of a short-term mark paper\nmarket in certificates of deposit or commercial paper.\n    Many U.S. Investment and money centre banks in particular\nwere hoping experience in these would provide the lever to\nprise open tight credit relationships between companies and\ntheir domestic \"house\" banks.\n    At the moment, U.S. Investment banks are expanding fastest\nhere. A unit of Salomon Inc <SB.N> began last summer and Morgan\nStanley Group Inc <MS.N> is currently fitting out offices,\nprobably for a summer start to business.\n    A unit of <Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co> should begin\noperations toward year end. Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MER.N>\nand Shearson Lehman Brothers are known to be weighing\nconversion of current, small operations to full-standing units.\n    But expansion had been hampered by the lack of experienced\npersonnel in a hitherto fairly small market. The big three\nSwiss banks, which arrived between late 1985 and first half\n1986, have been steadily building up securities departments,\ntaking staff equally from domestic and foreign competitors.\n    The two U.S. Banks longest established here, Citibank AG\nand Chase Bank AG, had been particularly hard hit.\n    Both banks recently announced plans to cut back commercial\nactivities and shut down German branch offices on orders from\nhead office. In the competitive environment, return on assets\nemployed was insufficient to meet requirements, sources said.\n    But the weakening attraction of \"Financial Centre Germany\"\nwas unlikely to deter major Japanese banks from setting up full\nsubsidiaries when the Bundesbank gives the green light for mark\neurobond lead management probably around third quarter 1987.\n    Once banks such as Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd <DIKB.T> and\nSumitomo Bank Ltd <SUMI.T> move in, competition for business,\nfor staff and even for premises would soar, sources said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 08:25:50.90","places":["west-germany","usa","uk","japan"]},"13630":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 08:26:40.98"},"13631":{"title":"U.S. AID CHIEF TO BE NAMED TO TOP TREASURY POST","body":"President Reagan will shortly\nnominate the head of the U.S. program for Third World\ndevelopment, Peter McPherson, as second-ranking officer of the\nDepartment of the Treasury, administration sources said.\n    They said the White House was expected to announce\nMcPherson's nomination to succeed Richard Darman as deputy\nTreasury scretary later this week.\n    The nomination is subject to Senate approval.\n    McPherson has headed the Agency for International\nDevelopment (AID) since 1981.

The loan is for 10 years,\nwith four years grace. Interest will be at 1-1/8 pct during the\ngrace period after which the margin will rise to 1-1/4 pct,\nCabrera said. There is also a front end fee of one pct.\n    The cost of the project totals 301.6 mln dlrs, of which ISA\nwill contribute about 100 mln and the IADB 115 mln, he added.\n    Fuji Bank Ltd and Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd are arranging\nthe commercial bank portion of the financing. Cabrera noted\nthat only about 20 pct of the loan will be drawn this year.\n    He said the World Bank co-financing is likely to come to\nthe market no earlier than June. It is part of an overall\nfinancing for various projects in the electrical sector that\nwill take four years and cost about 300 mln dlrs a year.\n    Of the total cost, he expects the World Bank and the IADB\nto contribute about 700 mln dlrs, with the Export-Import Bank\nof Japan lending between 200 and 300 mln. The balance will come\nfrom commercial banks.\n    Cabrera said that Colombia also plans one other issue in\nthe international capital markets this year.\n    The country expected to launch up to 120 mln dlrs in\nfloating rate notes, but the market has virtually disappeared\nin the past few months as supply outstripped demand and the\nnumber of market makers contracted sharply.\n    Cabrera said he is now considering several options,\nincluding a fixed rate Eurobond and an issue in Japan. Last\nyear Colombia arranged a private placement in Japan for the\nequivalent of about 40 mln dlrs. Although it prefers a public\nissue, Colombia would place any financing in Japan privately.\n    Bankers noted that the floating rate note signed yesterday,\nwhich was for seven years with four years grace and paid 1-1/8\npct over Libor, was basically a \"disguised loan.\"\n    Cabrera said that as of December 31, 1986, Colombia had 11\nbillion dlrs of public sector foreign debt and 3.4 billion dlrs\nof private sector debt.\n    Of its planned total borrowings this year of two billion\ndlrs, he said that about 1.4 billion had been arranged before\nthe end of 1986 and that most of the borrowings in 1987 will be\ndrawn in future years.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 10:01:43.43","places":["uk","colombia","japan"]},"13810":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 10:01:46.69"},"13811":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 10:01:54.64"},"13812":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 10:02:02.28"},"13813":{"date":" 7-APR-1987 10:02:20.72"},"13814":{"title":"MIDWEST CASH GRAIN - MODEST MOVEMENT, BIDS FIRM","body":"Country movement of corn and soybeans\nincreased modestly this morning, and basis bids were steady to\nhigher, cash grain dealers said.\n    Basis bids firmed in response to lower rates for barge\nfreight, traders said, noting that the Ohio River is swelling\nwith snow runoff, discouraging barge loadings because of the\nhigh water levels.\n    Moderate bookings continued in new crop soybeans, mostly\nfor January 1988 delivery, with farmers pricing at least a\nportion of their crop at five dlrs a bushel or better when bids\nemerge at that level, they said.\n    Movement in Iowa was expected to slow considerably in the\nnext few days, as farmers are beginning field work, they said.\n    Dealers bid 104 and offered 106 pct for PIK certificates.\n                  CORN             SOYBEANS\n TOLEDO         5 UND MAY UP 1   2 UND MAY UNC\n CINCINNATI     1 OVR MAY UP 2   3 OVR MAY UP 2\n NEW HAVEN     12 UND MAY UNC    4 UND MAY UNC\n N.E.

The Bundesbank could now\nassume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency\ninflows slow down.\n    Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and\nlong term interest rate differentials, also encouraged\ninvestors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Mueller\nsaid.\n    The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary\ngrowth back onto the desired path, he said.\n    \"Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this\nquiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the\nchanged economic situation of the last few months,\" he added.\n    \"All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money\nsupply policy with the January discount rate cut, despite\nsuppositions to the contrary,\" Mueller said.\n    \"Keeping money supply developments in check is not always\nsynonymous with raising interest rates, especially when\nexcessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than\ngrowth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary\nholdings of non-banks,\" Mueller said.\n    Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits\nother concepts were needed for monetary policy.\n    Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for\nmonetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate.\n    In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S.\nCurrency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said.\n    But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of\na strict stability policy because both interest rates and\nliquidity would be affected by required currency intervention\nand could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank.\n    Even interest rates are not in the centre of the\nBundesbank's considerations, but reflect competition and other\nmarket conditions, Mueller said.\n    A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central\nbank money stock, the Bundesbank's main money supply indicator.\n    This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity\nof industry and households which cannot be directly reached\nwith the Bundesbank's instruments, Mueller said.\n    The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the\nharder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly been\nthe case recently, because non-banks have received considerable\nsums from current account surpluses and capital imports.\n    \"If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise\nwith higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if\ncredit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed\nits target but probably even set off further inflows,\" he said.\n    Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high.\n    In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate\nof seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter.\n    The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to\nsix pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock\ngrowth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said.\n    But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there\nshould be no change in priorities. \"Monetary policy must be\nfirst and foremost stability policy and successful stability\npolicy is money supply policy -- nothing else,\" he said.\n REUTER\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 10:41:17.67","topics":["money-supply","money-fx"],"places":["west-germany"]},"13950":{"title":"VOLCKER URGES GREATER EXCHANGE RATE STABILITY","body":"Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul\nVolcker said international policymakers should make improving\nthe stability of exchange rates a major priority.\n    In testimony before a Senate Banking subcommittee, Volcker\nsaid he does not have any specific proposals for improving\nexchange rate stability, but thought it was worthy goal.\n    \"I do think we ought to be thinking about and working toward\ngreater exchange rate stability,\" Volcker said. \"I think that the\nobjective of greater exchange rate stability ought to loom\nlarger among our various policy priorities.\"\n Reuter\n\u0003","date":" 7-APR-1987 10:41:26.61","topics":["money-fx"],"places":["usa"]},"13951":{"title":"N.Y.
